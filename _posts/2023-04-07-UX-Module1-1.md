### Introduction to Course 4

> Samar - Working as a self-taught UX Researcher

- "As a student, I used all my vacations to try different internships and learn about different fields to find what clicked with me"
- "I could use what I'm good at and then build on that to do something that I'm more passionate about"

### Understand the UX research process

> Understand the UX research process

- **Research study**: A step-by-step examination of a group of users and their needs, which adds realistic context to the design process

1-1 plan the study
- To plan a study, start by outlining the background for the project. 

1-2 set goals for your research
- write down the questions you want to answer 
- Then establish the steps you'll take to conduct the study and select the people who will participate in the study. 

2 conduct the research 
- During this step, you'll gather data
- There are several techniques you can use, but the one we'll focus on in this course is called a **usability study**
	- A usability study is a research method that assesses how easy it is for users to complete core tasks in a design. 
    - The goal of usability study is to identify pain points that the user experiences with your designs so the issues can be fixed before the final product launches. 
    - During a usability study, you get a chance to see how users interact with your new product or feature. 

3 analyze and synthesize your results
- This involves trying to find the actual meaning in the data. You want to figure out why the data is the way it is. 
- Look for patterns in the quantitative data and explore trends in the qualitative data from participants' answers to interview questions. 

4 share and promote your insights with the project's stakeholders 
  - Project stakeholders are people who are involved in the project or who will be impacted by its results. 
  - Project stakeholders need the results of your research and need to agree with the direction of the project.

> Language and communication in UX research

- One of the most essential aspects of conducting research is understanding how to communicate effectively with all different kinds of people.

- Language and communicaion matter
	- When it comes to UX research, written and spoken language play a very important role in the success of your product and the feedback you receive about your designs.
	- The language you use while conducting research directly affects the language your participants use. 
    
- Consider word choices 
	- When conducting research, it’s important that you understand your own ideas on language use, as well as the ideas other communities have about language. 
    - There’s no right or wrong way to communicate an idea, but language often reveals hidden power imbalances. When conducting research, you want to make sure you’re communicating in a way that’s inviting, not commanding. 
    - For example, avoid using words that are considered ableist, or words that assume a person does not have a disability.

- Keep the context in mind
	- You also need to consider the context that the research is happening in, such as the physical space where the research study is taking place. 
    - You want participants to feel like there’s an equal power dynamic between them and you as the researcher. 
    - For example, if one person is sitting and the other person is standing, there’s an unequal power dynamic and the situation can feel awkward or off putting. 

> Get to know the seven elements of a research plan

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/2d70b17f-3b02-4bea-b836-8fce9d0e2fb9/image.png)
1) Project background
- We're creating a new app to help people find and schedule dog walkers. We need to find out if the main user experience, finding and scheduling a dog walker, is easy for users to complete

2) Research goal
- Determine if the dog walker app is difficult to use

3) Research questions
- How long does it take a user to find and book a dog walker in the app?
- What can we learn from the user flow, or the steps that users take, to book a dog walker?

4) Key performance indicators (KPI)
- Percentage of users who book a dog walker

5) Methodology
- Conduct a survey of prospective users
- Use a spreadsheet and identify trends

6) Participants
- Dog owners with full-time jobs and who go out for activities more than once a week

7) Script
- Did you face any challenges when trying to book a dog walker in the app?

> Start building a research plan: project background, research goals, and research questions

- **Importance of project background**
- Gets the team on the same page at the beginning of study
- Shows you understand why you're doing this research
- Promotes confidence in the overall quality of your analysis and insights

- **How to write the project background**
- Identify the signals that indicated research was necessary
- Describe any previous research 
- List insights the research will generate
	- Insight: An observation about people that helps you understand the user or their needs from a new perspective
    
<hr/>   
 
- **Foundational research goal**
- Understand why or if you should build the product 
 
- **Design research goal**
- Understand how to build the product 
- It will give you the answers you need to move forward through the design process with confidence
- In our example, the goal of design research would be to learn how you should build the do walking app and what features it will need in order to solve the user's problem

- **Post-launch research goal**
- Understand if the product worked as expected

<hr/>   

- **How to write research questions**
- Actionable
- Specific
- Avoid leading questions (Research questions should be neutrally phrased so they don’t lead the participants to a particular answer. Leading questions will result in inaccurate data, since the question directs participants to the answer that the team wants instead of identifying user needs)

- **Quantitative research**
- Focuses on data that can be gathered by counting or measuring
	- ex) On average, how many times a week does a user hire a dog walker through the app?
- **Qualitative research**
- Focuses on observations about why and how things happen
	- ex) What frustrated users most about finding a dog walker through the app?

> Continue building a research plan: KPIs

- Key performance indicators (KPIs): Critical measures of progress toward an end goal 
- Key performance indicators:

**Time on task**
- How long it takes for a user to complete a task
- For example, you might time how long it takes for a user to start from the home screen of your app and complete the checkout flow to purchase a shirt. It’s generally safe to assume that the less time it takes for users to perform a task, the more effective your design is. 

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/9b9bd654-9277-4b52-9a99-1fcbff6f7deb/image.png)
**Use of naviation vs. search**
- The number of people who use a website or app's navigation compared to the number of people who use the search functionality
- In other words, some users will prefer to use the navigation bar to get around your product, while others will go straight to the search bar, type in a query, and be directed to part of the product.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/58f45279-16c5-4484-a43d-ad01bc26b1d2/image.png)
**User error rates**
- Indicate the parts of a design that cause users to make errors
- For example, a user might click on the wrong icon when trying to make a purchase, forget to check a box, or submit incorrect information when filling out a form.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/4d38f4ac-7aba-4cbe-bf5f-461c306e1ce6/image.png)
**Drop-off rates**
- How many users abandon the experience
- In other words, this KPI reveals how many users quit before reaching the end of a purchase or some other endpoint you’re trying to lead them to. 
- Users might quit using your product if the navigation is difficult to understand, if they get frustrated while trying to complete a task, or if they simply get bored. 

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/881824d8-7920-43df-81e7-a2db28ca0c12/image.png)
**Conversion rates**
- Measures the percentage of users who complete a desired action
- Conversion rates are the opposite of drop-off rates. Any time a user successfully completes a task, meets a goal, or makes it to the final destination of your product, it’s a conversion.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/0d400aa8-d693-4ca3-8737-2f684298dfce/image.png)
**System Usability Scale (SUS)**
- A questionnaire to measure the usability of your designs
![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/5c67ca31-8ef7-412c-852a-ebae28d83ba1/image.png)
- In an SUS, users are asked the extent to which they agree or disagree with 10 statements about the usability of a design.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/9aed6bff-9fec-4010-82b6-9d888c8142df/image.png)
**Net Promoter Score (NPS)**
- A measure of how loyal users will be to your product or service. The NPS measures the likelihood that a user would recommend your product to a friend or colleague. 
- Participants rate the question, “Would you recommend this product to a friend or colleague?” on a scale of 0 to 10. 
	- **Promoters** are participants who give a rating of 9 or 10, which means they would recommend your product to others. 
	- **Passives** are participants who give a rating of 7 or 8, which means they are satisfied with your product, but they probably won’t pass it along to friends or colleagues. 
	- **Detractors** are participants who rate from 0 to 6, which means they could warn people away from your product or service. 

### Build a UX research plan (part 2)

> Continue building a research plan: Methodology

- Methodology: The steps you take to conduct your research
- The methodology informs your stakeholders of what will happen during the study, how long the study is, and where it will take place
- detailing your methodology will give stakeholders more confidence in your study's results, because they can see all ot the steps
- The methodology provides the details that other researchers need to repeat the exact same study in the future

> Learn more about methodology

- **Methodology** involves the steps you’ll take to conduct research, collect data, and analyze data. When thinking about the methodology, it’s important to consider 1) the type of research method involved, 2) the steps involved in the research method, and 3) the type of data that will be generated from the research method. 

- **Comparing research methods**
- **Primary research** is research you conduct yourself, while **secondary research** is research that uses information someone else has put together. 
	- Some examples of primary research are interviews—which you conducted in Course 2—surveys, competitive audits, and usability studies. Another point to consider is whether the research method is quantitative or qualitative. 
- **Qualitative research** focuses observations on why and how things happen, and **quantitative research** focuses on data that can be gathered by counting or measuring. 

- **Conducting research with a usability study**
- Usability studies are primary, qualitative research methods because they allow UX designers to make direct and indirect observations based on the participants’ behavior and words.

> Continue building a research plan: Participants
- Characteristics 
- Screener survey
- Incentive
- Diverse perspectives and abilities

> Assistive technology for participants with disabilities

- Accessibility means the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. 
- One of your key priorities as a UX designer is to create products that are usable and accessible to all people.

-**Accessibility is for everyone**
![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/42a6213d-85ae-4614-92ec-b7dd49bc40b3/image.png)
- As a UX designer, you need to design for people with disabilities that are permanent, temporary, or situational.
- A **permanent disability** is one that affects a person long-term, like losing sight, hearing, speech, or mobility. For example, Amir, a person with permanent blindness, uses a walking stick to navigate their surroundings. 
- A **temporary impairment** is a short-term illness or ailment that can be caused by an injury or other limitation. Consider Margo, who has temporarily blurred vision without their glasses. 
- A **situational challenge** occurs when a person’s environment blocks certain functions. For example, Juan cannot read text messages on their mobile phone while driving a car. Instead, Juan uses voice commands to hear and send texts while driving. 

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/d207edbb-30dc-406f-8a2a-5f4a92ec145b/image.png)
- An **assistive technology (AT)** is a product, equipment, or a system that enhances learning, working, and living for people with disabilities
- A **screen reader** is an AT that interprets and verbalizes text, button names, keyboard strokes, and code that a website or app is composed of. Screen readers are often used by people with low vision. In addition to screen readers, some people with low vision might use a computer or smart device with a high contrast screen or increased magnification. 

- A **switch** is an AT that helps people with disabilities use technology - like computers, phones, appliances, and mobility equipment - with minimal movements and gestures. A switch can come in many forms, like a button or clicker. For a computer, a switch might replace a traditional keyboard and mouse. 

- **Closed captioning and speech-to-text** are both ATs that convert audio into text for people with limited hearing. 

- **Reminder alarms** with simplified text and supporting images can help people with cognitive disabilities remember important information. For example, Android phones have a feature called Action Blocks where users add common actions to their home screen with a name or image. So a photo of your mother on the home screen of your phone will call her phone number. 

- **Augmentative and Alternative Communication (AAC) devices** are ATs that support people with cognitive disabilities who may experience speech limitations or learning disabilities by using images to communicate instead of words.

> Finish building a research plan: Script

- **Tips for writing a usability script**
- Use the same set of questions for each interview
- Ask open-ended questions
- Encourage elaboration
- Ask the same question from different angles
- Don't mention other users
- Don't ask leading questions
