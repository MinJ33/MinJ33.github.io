> Samar - Working as a self-taught UX Researcher

- "As a student, I used all my vacations to try different internships and learn about different fields to find what clicked with me"
- "I could use what I'm good at and then build on that to do something that I'm more passionate about"

### Understand the UX research process

> Understand the UX research process

- **Research study**: A step-by-step examination of a group of users and their needs, which adds realistic context to the design process

1-1 plan the study
- To plan a study, start by outlining the background for the project. 

1-2 set goals for your research
- write down the questions you want to answer 
- Then establish the steps you'll take to conduct the study and select the people who will participate in the study. 

2 conduct the research 
- During this step, you'll gather data
- There are several techniques you can use, but the one we'll focus on in this course is called a **usability study**
	- A usability study is a research method that assesses how easy it is for users to complete core tasks in a design. 
    - The goal of usability study is to identify pain points that the user experiences with your designs so the issues can be fixed before the final product launches. 
    - During a usability study, you get a chance to see how users interact with your new product or feature. 

3 analyze and synthesize your results
- This involves trying to find the actual meaning in the data. You want to figure out why the data is the way it is. 
- Look for patterns in the quantitative data and explore trends in the qualitative data from participants' answers to interview questions. 

4 share and promote your insights with the project's stakeholders 
  - Project stakeholders are people who are involved in the project or who will be impacted by its results. 
  - Project stakeholders need the results of your research and need to agree with the direction of the project.
