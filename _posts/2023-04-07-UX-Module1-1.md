## 4. Conduct UX Research and Test Early Concepts
### Module 1: Planning UX research studies

> Learning Objectives
	- Explain why and how to include data privacy in user research
	- Build a script for a UX research study
	- Determine participants for a UX research study
	- Define Key Performance Indicators for a UX research study
	- Describe how research questions inform research methods
	- Plan a UX research study
	- Define the steps in the UX research process
	- Identify examples of common UX research studies

### Introduction to Course 4

> Samar - Working as a self-taught UX Researcher

- "As a student, I used all my vacations to try different internships and learn about different fields to find what clicked with me"
- "I could use what I'm good at and then build on that to do something that I'm more passionate about"

### Understand the UX research process

> Understand the UX research process

- **Research study**: A step-by-step examination of a group of users and their needs, which adds realistic context to the design process

1-1 plan the study
- To plan a study, start by outlining the background for the project. 

1-2 set goals for your research
- write down the questions you want to answer 
- Then establish the steps you'll take to conduct the study and select the people who will participate in the study. 

2 conduct the research 
- During this step, you'll gather data
- There are several techniques you can use, but the one we'll focus on in this course is called a **usability study**
	- A usability study is a research method that assesses how easy it is for users to complete core tasks in a design. 
    - The goal of usability study is to identify pain points that the user experiences with your designs so the issues can be fixed before the final product launches. 
    - During a usability study, you get a chance to see how users interact with your new product or feature. 

3 analyze and synthesize your results
- This involves trying to find the actual meaning in the data. You want to figure out why the data is the way it is. 
- Look for patterns in the quantitative data and explore trends in the qualitative data from participants' answers to interview questions. 

4 share and promote your insights with the project's stakeholders 
  - Project stakeholders are people who are involved in the project or who will be impacted by its results. 
  - Project stakeholders need the results of your research and need to agree with the direction of the project.

- Raise new insights with the project's stakeholders
	> share and promote your insights

- Take notes in a spreadsheet
	> conduct the research 

- Observe how participants interact with your design
	> conduct the research 

- Create a presentation
	> share and promote your insights

- Provide your recommendations
	> share and promote your insights
    
- Look for patterns in the quantitative data
	> analyze and synthesize your results

- Write down questions to ask study participants
	> plan the study

- Outline the background for the project

> Language and communication in UX research

- One of the most essential aspects of conducting research is understanding how to communicate effectively with all different kinds of people.

- Language and communicaion matter
	- When it comes to UX research, written and spoken language play a very important role in the success of your product and the feedback you receive about your designs.
	- The language you use while conducting research directly affects the language your participants use. 
    
- Consider word choices 
	- When conducting research, it’s important that you understand your own ideas on language use, as well as the ideas other communities have about language. 
    - There’s no right or wrong way to communicate an idea, but language often reveals hidden power imbalances. When conducting research, you want to make sure you’re communicating in a way that’s inviting, not commanding. 
    - For example, avoid using words that are considered ableist, or words that assume a person does not have a disability.

- Keep the context in mind
	- You also need to consider the context that the research is happening in, such as the physical space where the research study is taking place. 
    - You want participants to feel like there’s an equal power dynamic between them and you as the researcher. 
    - For example, if one person is sitting and the other person is standing, there’s an unequal power dynamic and the situation can feel awkward or off putting.

1) Project background
- We're creating a new app to help people find and schedule dog walkers. We need to find out if the main user experience, finding and scheduling a dog walker, is easy for users to complete

2) Research goal
- Determine if the dog walker app is difficult to use

3) Research questions
- How long does it take a user to find and book a dog walker in the app?
- What can we learn from the user flow, or the steps that users take, to book a dog walker?

4) Key performance indicators (KPI)
- Percentage of users who book a dog walker

5) Methodology
- Conduct a survey of prospective users
- Use a spreadsheet and identify trends

6) Participants
- Dog owners with full-time jobs and who go out for activities more than once a week

7) Script
- Did you face any challenges when trying to book a dog walker in the app?
