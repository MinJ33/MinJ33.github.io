## 2. Start the UX Design Process: Empathize, Define, and Ideate
### Module 3: Define user problems

> Learning Objectives
- Explain the steps to scope design problems
- Build a problem statement
- Define a value proposition
- Explain how psychology and human factors influence design[Optional] 
- Build a hypothesis statement

> Create problem statements

- **Problem statement**: A clear description of the user's needs that should be addressed 


	- Human-centered
    - Broad enough for creative freedom
    - Narrow enough to be solved by a design
- It can be written using a simple formula:

- **Advantage** of using problem statement


	- Establish goals
    - Understand contraints
    - Define deliverables
    - Create benchmarks for success

> Define problem statements

**The 5 Ws and H: who, what when, where, why, and how**
- The most common framework used to create problem statements is the 5 Ws and H framework. After you define the user’s pain points, you can answer who, what, when, where, why, and how to solve the user’s problem.

- **Who** is experiencing the problem? Knowing your users and their background is key to creating successful solutions for them.
- **What** are the pain points you’re trying to solve? Determining a user’s pain points early allows you to answer the rest of these questions and clarify the context of the pain points.
- **Where** is the user when they’re using the product? A user’s physical context matters to your design.
- **When** does the problem occur? Maybe it’s right after the end of a long and tedious process, or maybe it’s something that happens daily. Knowing when the problem occurs can help you better empathize with the user’s feelings. 
- **Why** is the problem important? Knowing how this problem affects your user’s experience and life will help to clarify the potential consequences.
- **How** are users reaching their goals by using the product? Understanding how users reach their goals allows you to map the user journey that they take through your product.

- For example, think about the dog walker app and one of our user personas, Arnold. Arnold is in his late fifties, and his kids have encouraged him to upgrade to a smartphone. Arnold is a leader at his company, and not used to admitting he's uncomfortable with technology. After his wife died, Arnold became the primary caregiver of the family's animals. But, he works over sixty hours per week, and is unable to take his three dogs on twice-daily walks. Arnold is turning to the dog walker app for help. 

- Who: A busy executive
- What: Arnold wants to hire a daily dog walker for his three dogs.
- Where: Arnold is likely using the app at work, on the go. 
- When: Arnold gets frustrated when he opens the app, starting from the very beginning of the user journey. 
- Why: Arnold doesn’t have a lot of experience with phone apps or similar technology. 
- How: Arnold wants to go easily from the home screen of the app to the list of dog walkers to the confirmation screen.

> Define hypothesis statements

- Empathizing with users allows you to consider the product experience from the users’ perspective. By connecting with people directly, like through interviews, you can discover and understand users' likes, dislikes, and pain points. 

- Then, sort through research you collected about users to **define** the problem they're facing. Creating a problem statement helps you clearly define the user pain points that your future designs can address. 

- **Hypothesis statement**: Our best educated guess on what we think the solution to a design problem might be.
Hypothesis statements don’t have a single standard formula to follow, but there are two common methods you can try using to write one. 

1) **if / then format**
![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/be51520b-3afe-4c7e-8beb-2ddb6e070a71/image.png)

Example:
- If Arnold downloads the dog walker app, then they can utilize the “simplified” mode setting to view only the basic app functions. 

- If Tobias signs up for the dog walker app, then they will quickly and easily pick a walker that fits their schedule.

2) **we believe format**
- We believe that a simplified mode of the dog walker app for Arnold will allow them to hire dog walkers efficiently.

- We believe that easy access to available dog walkers for Tobias will increase the amount of walks they choose for their pets. 

- If / then statements focus directly on the needs of users. On the other hand, we believe statements take the perspective of your team into account, while remaining empathetic to the needs of users.

> Determine a value proposition

**Value proposition**: The reason why a consumer should use a product or service.
- Value propositions ensure that users have a reason to use the product that you are creating, as opposed to any other product currently available
- Value proposition example:
	-Check out a product you might recognize - Gmail – and ask yourself if you can identify a few of its value propositions. When Google debuted Gmail in 2004, they were entering an already crowded market of free email services. Gmail offered: 
		- The ability to send and receive emails for free
		- Email sorting, archiving, and starring functions
		- Spam filtering for inboxes
		- Email conversation views
		- 1 gigabyte of cloud storage
- Two of the items on that list were unique offerings that no other email services provided at the time: email conversation views, which put individual emails in the context of a larger thread, and an entire gigabyte of storage, which was 1,000 times the amount of storage that competitors offered. Those were Gmail’s unique value propositions.
