### Understand design systems

> Introduction to design systems

- **Design system**: A series of reusabule elements and guidelines that allow teams to design and develop a product, following predetermined standards
- **Visual design system elements**
	- Colour
    - Iconography

- Most design systems include visual styles, guidelines for how to apply them, UI patterns, and supporting code for developers.

> Benefits of design systems

- **Benefits of design systems**
	- Create consistency for designers and users
    - Reinforce a company's brand identity
    - Scalable: Describes a system that's able to maintain performance levels when workload increases
    - Save time and money by increasing efficiency
    - Help designers and developers work together more effectively

> Google's design system: Material Design

- Material Design is a public design system created by Google, and it's used by designers and developers around the world to create different mobile apps and websites

### Create a sticker sheet

> Create a sticker sheet in Figma

- **Sticker sheets**: A collection of elements and components that make up part of the design system

- Figma allows you to label the first component you make as the component and refer to any copies of this component as component instances
- To make it easier to keep track of where my components are, place them on a sticker sheet

> Get inspiration from design systems

- A **design system** is a series of reusable elements that allow teams to design and develop a product following predetermined standards. 
- A design system is the visual foundation of a company’s products and is key to attracting users. 
- For UX designers, design systems are a great way to maintain consistency within a design and across products. 

- **Showcase a design system in your portfolio**
- Once you create a design system for the product you're designing in this course, you’ll want to include it in your portfolio. For example, Google UX designer Dane co-created an app called Pocket for a class project. In Dane's portfolio case study, he included details about the product’s design system, like the typography, iconography, and buttons, as shown in the image below:

> Use a design system library in Figma

- **Elevation**: Material Design's system for adding layering or depth to your interface
	- The screen background is usually at zero elevation, while a button might be at four elevation
