## 1. Foundations of User Experience (UX) Design
### Module 2: Thinking like a UX designer

> User-centered design

- Focusing on real user problems reduces the impact of designer bias.
- Puts the user front-and-center
- As a UX designer, your goal is to keep the user at the center of every decision you make, and to do that, you need to get to know your user.

- 4 steps:
	Understand: Understand how the user experiences the product or similar products.
    Specify: Specify the end user's needs. Narrow down which end-user problem is the most important to solve.
    Design: Design solutions to the end user's problem. 
    Evaluate: Evaluate your design against your end user's needs. You'll also do it by testing your product with real people

Imp: It is impotant to keep in mind that **iteration** is the key.
- Iteration: Doing something again, by building on previous versions and making tweaks.

> Who are my users?

Do my users have impairments or disabilities to consider?
- The term accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. 
- As a UX designer, it’s important to keep users with disabilities in mind as you design features or new products.
- Example: inclusive product features that increase magnification, like enlarged fonts. Or features that help everyone understand videos, like closed captions.
#
How familiar are my users with technology?
- User experience also includes paying attention to the needs of people who are about to become users. That is, the level of ***digital literacy*** of potential users is the key.
- Digital literacy: the ability to use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills.
- Example: People with limited digital literacy might not know what "swipe" means in relation to a touchscreen.
#
How are my users accessing the product or service?
- Not all users will access to product or service in the same way due to the cost and availability of devices and internet services.
- As a UX designer, you should try to find ways to take the offline experience into account as well.
#
Where are my users accessing the product or service?
- Keep in mind that cultures and norms are ever-changing as people integrate and recontextualize technology in their lives.
- So you’ll need to continue to research potential users to identify shifts in user problems, preferences, and usage patterns over time.
- Example: a user might want to read in Hindi but type using the English keyboard.
#
-The goal for user research is to get the widest possible selection of potential users to include as research participants. Make sure to consider income level; demographic data such as age, gender, and ethnicity; educational background; and geographic location. 

> Assistive Technology (AT)

- Any products, equipment, and systems that enchance learning, working, and daily living for people with disabilities. 

- Kinds of Assertive techonolgies
	- Color modification: High contrast mode or dark mode on a device, increases the contrast or colours on a screen. It makes the interface easier to see for people with low vision. 
    - Voice control: It helps with limited dexterity and can serve as an alternative to a keyboard or mouse. It allows users to navigate and interact with the buttons and screens on their devices using only their voice.
    	- **Switch**: An assistive techonology device that replaces the need to use a computer keyboard or a mouse
    - Screen readers: One of the most common assistive technologies for people with limited vision. The software works on mobile and web devices and reads out loud any on screen text. 
    - Alternative text: It helps translate a visual user interface into a text-based user interface. It essentially uses words to describe any meaningful image for someone who isn't able to see the image. It is also helpful for those with low bandwidth connections too. 

> Akhil - Thinking about users new to technology

- "The strange thing about UX design is that you won't really notice it if it's good design. You only notice it when it's bad."

***Low-end devices***
- It could mean people don't have enough storage on their phone, which means they can't install a big enough app. (low-storage device)
- An example of using a low-storage device: sometimes they won't have access to data or they have access to flaky data. So you want to make sure that your app  works offline just as well as it works online. 

***Literacy***
- A lot of these users aren't literate or they might not speak English, whereas a lot of the internet is serving people who speak English.
- How do we make multilingual interfaces?

> Design Thinking: A UX design framework

***Framework***
- It is a conceptual tool that provides guidance on the best practices and processes for solving  problems and building solutions that solve the problems of real users.
- It provides structure for the design process and foster collaboration, which can spark innovations

***Design Thinking Framework***
- The Design Thinking framework is a user-centered approach to problem-solving
- This involves the following phases: empathize, define, ideate, prototype, and test.
- It should be iterative, which means that you’ll repeat certain phases as you refine your designs.

***Empathize***
- The primary goal of this step is to learn about the user and their problems, wants, and needs
- The most important part of the empathize phase is to step away from your assumptions and guesses and let your research findings inform your decision-making in later design phases.
- Your user research might include user surveys, interviews, and observation sessions

***Define***
- In this phase, you will analyze your research findings from the empathize phase and determine which user problems are the most important ones to solve, and why
- The most important outcome of this phase is a clear problem statement, which is a description of the user’s need that your designs will address

***Ideate***
- The goal of ideation is to come up with as many design solutions as possible  with other members of your team to generate as many solutions as possible to a problem
- This could include marketing, engineering, product management, or any other stakeholders for the product or service.
- The important thing here is to keep this process judgment-free.
- After brainstorming, you’ll then analyze your potential solutions and start to make choices about which ones are the best options to pursue as prototypes

***Prototype and Test***
- The goal in this phase is to produce an early model of a product that demonstrates its functionality and can be used for testing.
- It is critical to developing the right solution to address your user’s problem, and an organized approach to testing can help you create exceptional user experiences.
- Prototyping and testing are  interconnected, which means that you’ll  test your designs at each stage of prototype development rather than waiting to test until after the working prototype is complete.
- The goal of testing prototypes is to  continue to refine the prototype as you gain insight into whether the design for your product or service is easy to use and solves the user’s problem.

> Universal design, inclusive design, and equity-focused design

***Universal design***
- The process of creating one product for users with the widest range of abilities and in the widest range of situations. 

***Inclusive design***
- Making design chocies that take into account personal identifiers like:
	- Ability
    - Race
    - Economic status
    - Language
    - Age
    - Gender
- Inclusive design includes researchers and designers from traditionally excluded populations in the process, so they can provide their unique perspectives during all phases of the design process.
- If universal design is a one-size-fits-all solution, then inclusive design can be described as solve for one, extend to many. 
- Accessibility is just one aspect of inclusive design.
	- Accessibility: The design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities.
    
> Learn more about accessibility from Google
- If you’re ready to learn more about accessibility, check out this three-part series from Google UX researchers about building globally accessible products.

- Designing for Global Accessibility, Part I: Awareness is everything outlines how you can increase your awareness of accessibility issues and check your assumptions about users.

- Designing for Global Accessibility, Part II: Context matters explores why it’s critical to consider logistics during the design process, in order to expand your app’s usability and usefulness.

- Designing for Global Accessibility, Part III: Be inclusive by default discusses how UX designers can make tactical decisions to create inclusive apps.

***equity-focused design***
- Designing for groups that have been historically underrepresented or ignored when building products.  
- In order to design with equity as a goal, we first need to know the difference between equality and equity
![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/8192073f-6ad4-4306-9aeb-073334d5d553/image.png)
- Equality vs equity
	- Equality means providing the ***same*** amount of opportunity and support to all segments of society. In other words, everyone gets the same thing. 
    - Equity means providing ***different*** levels of opportunity and support for each person in order to achieve fair outcomes.

> The importance of equity-focused design
- Thinking through all the aspects of a designed product and making sure the product is both accessible and fair to all genders, races, and abilites. 
- Plus, the designs need to specifically consider underrepresented and excluded groups. 

> Get to know platforms
- Platform: The medium that users experience your product on such as desktops, mobile web, mobile apps, tablets, and more. 
- It's important to design with multiple platforms in mind, because users want a product to look and feel similar, no matter what platform they're using.
- Even though UX designers need to think across platforms, it's important to focus on one platform first when you build a new product. 
- In addition to having a consistent user experience across platforms, it's also important to have a consistent brand identity.

> Design for different platforms
- There's a big difference in the amount of time users spend on mobile phones compared to desktop computers. An average mobile session is 72 seconds, while the average desktop session is 150 seconds.
- It tells us that people use different devices in different ways. ***Mobile users*** tend to be ***goal-oriented***, and they are focused on completing a single task.
- Now, almost all websites use responsive web design. 
- Responsive web design allows a website to change automatically depending on the size of the device.
- Since mobile device usage has been booming, designers have had to think about a few best practices when designing for mobile user experiences.
	- First, call-to-action buttons should be placed front and center
    - Second, navigation menus should be short and simple. So menu options should only highlight the core functions of the product. 
    - Third, use gestures that users already do, like tapping and swiping.
    - Fourth, design for both directions a phone might be held. We need to consider the vertical portrait view of a mobile phone and the horizontal landscape view.
    - Fifth, reduce visual clutter. Mobile phones have smaller screen sizes, so it's important to keep the visual experience simple.
