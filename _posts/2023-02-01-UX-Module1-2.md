## 1. Foundations of User Experience (UX) Design
### Module 2: Thinking like a UX designer

> User-centered design

- Focusing on real user problems reduces the impact of designer bias.
- Puts the user front-and-center
- As a UX designer, your goal is to keep the user at the center of every decision you make, and to do that, you need to get to know your user.

- 4 steps:
	Understand: Understand how the user experiences the product or similar products.
    Specify: Specify the end user's needs. Narrow down which end-user problem is the most important to solve.
    Design: Design solutions to the end user's problem. 
    Evaluate: Evaluate your design against your end user's needs. You'll also do it by testing your product with real people

Imp: It is impotant to keep in mind that **iteration** is the key.
- Iteration: Doing something again, by building on previous versions and making tweaks.

> Who are my users?

Do my users have impairments or disabilities to consider?
- The term accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. 
- As a UX designer, it’s important to keep users with disabilities in mind as you design features or new products.
- Example: inclusive product features that increase magnification, like enlarged fonts. Or features that help everyone understand videos, like closed captions.
#
How familiar are my users with technology?
- User experience also includes paying attention to the needs of people who are about to become users. That is, the level of ***digital literacy*** of potential users is the key.
- Digital literacy: the ability to use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills.
- Example: People with limited digital literacy might not know what "swipe" means in relation to a touchscreen.
#
How are my users accessing the product or service?
- Not all users will access to product or service in the same way due to the cost and availability of devices and internet services.
- As a UX designer, you should try to find ways to take the offline experience into account as well.
#
Where are my users accessing the product or service?
- Keep in mind that cultures and norms are ever-changing as people integrate and recontextualize technology in their lives.
- So you’ll need to continue to research potential users to identify shifts in user problems, preferences, and usage patterns over time.
- Example: a user might want to read in Hindi but type using the English keyboard.
#
-The goal for user research is to get the widest possible selection of potential users to include as research participants. Make sure to consider income level; demographic data such as age, gender, and ethnicity; educational background; and geographic location.
