## 1. Foundations of User Experience (UX) Design
### Module 2: Thinking like a UX designer

> User-centered design

- Focusing on real user problems reduces the impact of designer bias.
- Puts the user front-and-center
- As a UX designer, your goal is to keep the user at the center of every decision you make, and to do that, you need to get to know your user.

- 4 steps:
	Understand: Understand how the user experiences the product or similar products.
    Specify: Specify the end user's needs. Narrow down which end-user problem is the most important to solve.
    Design: Design solutions to the end user's problem. 
    Evaluate: Evaluate your design against your end user's needs. You'll also do it by testing your product with real people

Imp: It is impotant to keep in mind that **iteration** is the key.
- Iteration: Doing something again, by building on previous versions and making tweaks.

> Who are my users?

Do my users have impairments or disabilities to consider?
- The term accessibility refers to the design of products, devices, services, or environments for people with disabilities. 
- As a UX designer, it’s important to keep users with disabilities in mind as you design features or new products.
- Example: inclusive product features that increase magnification, like enlarged fonts. Or features that help everyone understand videos, like closed captions.
#
How familiar are my users with technology?
- User experience also includes paying attention to the needs of people who are about to become users. That is, the level of ***digital literacy*** of potential users is the key.
- Digital literacy: the ability to use information and communication technologies to find, evaluate, create, and communicate information, requiring both cognitive and technical skills.
- Example: People with limited digital literacy might not know what "swipe" means in relation to a touchscreen.
#
How are my users accessing the product or service?
- Not all users will access to product or service in the same way due to the cost and availability of devices and internet services.
- As a UX designer, you should try to find ways to take the offline experience into account as well.
#
Where are my users accessing the product or service?
- Keep in mind that cultures and norms are ever-changing as people integrate and recontextualize technology in their lives.
- So you’ll need to continue to research potential users to identify shifts in user problems, preferences, and usage patterns over time.
- Example: a user might want to read in Hindi but type using the English keyboard.
#
-The goal for user research is to get the widest possible selection of potential users to include as research participants. Make sure to consider income level; demographic data such as age, gender, and ethnicity; educational background; and geographic location. 

> Assistive Technology (AT)

- Any products, equipment, and systems that enchance learning, working, and daily living for people with disabilities. 

- Kinds of Assertive techonolgies
	- Color modification: High contrast mode or dark mode on a device, increases the contrast or colours on a screen. It makes the interface easier to see for people with low vision. 
    - Voice control: It helps with limited dexterity and can serve as an alternative to a keyboard or mouse. It allows users to navigate and interact with the buttons and screens on their devices using only their voice.
    	- **Switch**: An assistive techonology device that replaces the need to use a computer keyboard or a mouse
    - Screen readers: One of the most common assistive technologies for people with limited vision. The software works on mobile and web devices and reads out loud any on screen text. 
    - Alternative text: It helps translate a visual user interface into a text-based user interface. It essentially uses words to describe any meaningful image for someone who isn't able to see the image. It is also helpful for those with low bandwidth connections too. 

> Akhil - Thinking about users new to technology

- "The strange thing about UX design is that you won't really notice it if it's good design. You only notice it when it's bad."

***Low-end devices***
- It could mean people don't have enough storage on their phone, which means they can't install a big enough app. (low-storage device)
- An example of using a low-storage device: sometimes they won't have access to data or they have access to flaky data. So you want to make sure that your app  works offline just as well as it works online. 

***Literacy***
- A lot of these users aren't literate or they might not speak English, whereas a lot of the internet is serving people who speak English.
- How do we make multilingual interfaces?
