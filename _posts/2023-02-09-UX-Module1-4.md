## 1. Foundations of User Experience (UX) Design
### Module 4: Integrating research into the design process.

> Learning Objectives

- Identify and account for biases in UX research
- Explain research methods to use during the product development life cycle
- Describe the role of UX research in the design process
- List common research methods in UX design

> Emily - The power of UX research

- "All of the engineers in the back room had a new appreciation for research, for our users, and really learned to empathize with our user through research."

> Introduction to UX research

- ***UX research***: Focuses on understanding user behaviours, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback.
- The goal of user experience research is to prioritize the user. We also want to make sure business needs are met. 
- UX research can help bridge the gap between what a business thinks the user needs and what the user actually needs, before an expensive and time-consuming product is made.

- ***Product development life cycle***: The process used to take a product from an idea to reality.
- User research is a continuous part of the product development life cycle. 
- Research that takes place before anything is designed (Phase 3: design) is usually called foundational research (also called as strategic or generative research.)

**Foundational research**
- Foundational research is always done **before** you start designing. Within the product development life cycle, foundational research happens **during the brainstorm stage** (stage one) to help you empathize with users, understand their needs, and inspire new design directions. During this stage, you will also make **personas and user stories**.
- Methods: Interviews, surveys, Focus groups, Competitive audit, Field studies, and Diary studies.
- Answers the questions:
	- What should we build?
    - What are the user problems?
    - How can we solve them?
- The goal of foundational research is to help define the problem you would like to design a solution for.

**Design reserach (or tactical research)**
- Design research is done **while** you design. Within the product development lifecycle, design research happens during the design stage (stage three) to help inform your designs, to fit the **needs of users**, and to **reduce risk**. Each time you create a new version of your design, new research should be done to evaluate what works well and what needs to be changed.
- Methods: **Usability study**, A/B testing, Cafe or guerrilla studies, Card sorting, and Intercepts
- Answers the questions:
	- How should we build?
    - How was your experience using the prototype today?
    - How easy or difficult was it to use? Why? Did you encounter any challenges? 
- The goal of design research is to inform how the product should be built and reduce the problems that occur as users interact with your prototype.

**Post-launch research**
- Post-launch research is done **after** the design is complete and your product has launched. Within the product development life cycle, post-launch research happens after the launch stage (stage five) to help **validate** that the product is meeting user needs through established metrics.
- Methods: A/B testing, Usability studies, Surveys, and Logs analysis
- Answers the question: 
	- Did we succeed?
- The goal of post-launch research is to understand how users experienced the product and whether it was a good or poor user experience. 
- You might also want to check your product's performance against the competition.

UX researcher qualities
- Empathy: Able to understand someone else's feelings or thoughts in a situation. 
- Pragmatism: A practical approach to problem-solving. Pragmatic people are focused on reaching goals. 
- Collaboration: The ability to work with a range of people, personalities, and work styles

- **Primary research** is research you conduct yourself. Information from direct interactions with users, like interviews, surveys, or usability studies, are considered primary research.

- **Secondary research** is research that uses information someone else has put together. For example, using information from sources like books, articles, or journals is considered secondary research.

- **Qualitative research** is primarily collected through observations and conversations. Qualitative research is based on understanding users’ needs and aims to answer questions like “why” or “how did this happen?”

- **Quantitative research** focuses on data that can be gathered by counting or measuring. Quantitative research is based on numerical data that’s often collected from large-scale surveys. This type of research aims to answer questions like “how many?” and “how much?”

- All four of these types of research can intermix. Primary and secondary research can be both qualitative and quantitative. For example, an interview is qualitative research. An interview conducted by you is primary research. If you review an article about an interview conducted by someone else, it’s secondary research. 

> Understand benefits and drawbacks of research methods

- The search method we choose depends on the question we're trying to answer. 

**Secondary Research**
- If we're just getting started with a project, we might use secondary research to know the stats, facts, and figures that **already exist** about our users.
- Benefits
	- Saves time and money
    - Immediately accessible
    - Backs up primary research
- Drawbacks
	- No first-hand user interaction
    - No specific user feedback

**Interviews**
- Interviews are a research method used to collect in-depth information on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings. Interviews can be performed one-on-one or in a group setting, like a focus group. 
- Interviews can take the form of qualitative and quantitative research. A qualitative research method includes open-ended questions that require participants to explain their answers by providing more details. A quantitative research method includes only close-ended questions, like questions that require only “yes”  or “no” responses or set multiple choice questions. 
- Benefits
	- Understand what users thinka and why
	- An opportunity to ask follow-up questions 
- Drawbacks
	-Take a lot of time and money. 
    - This means you'll end up with a small sample size, which can be risky when launching a brand new product.

**Surveys**
- A survey is an activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product
- You can design surveys to include open-ended questions for qualitative research, which allow research participants to clarify their survey responses, as well as close-ended questions for quantitative research, which generate numerical data. 
- Benefits
	- Larger sample size
    - Fast
    - Inexpensive
- Drawbacks
	- Lack of in-depth feedback

**Usability studies**
- A usability study is a technique used to evaluate a product by testing it on users. Usability studies help demonstrate if a product is on the right track or if the design needs to be adjusted.
- Qualitative research is based on observations, and a critical part of conducting usability studies is observing how participants interact with the product you’ve designed. Quantitative research can also be used when conducting usability studies to understand participants’ impressions of the product.
- Benefits
	- Firsthand user interaction
    - Challenge our assumptions
    - In-depth feedback
- Drawbacks
	- Only measure how easy a product is to use
    - Expensive
    - Difference in lab use versus real life
