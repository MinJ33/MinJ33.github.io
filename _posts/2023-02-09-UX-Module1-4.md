## 1. Foundations of User Experience (UX) Design
### Module 4: Integrating research into the design process.

> Learning Objectives

- Identify and account for biases in UX research
- Explain research methods to use during the product development life cycle
- Describe the role of UX research in the design process
- List common research methods in UX design

> Emily - The power of UX research

- "All of the engineers in the back room had a new appreciation for research, for our users, and really learned to empathize with our user through research."

> Introduction to UX research

- ***UX research***: Focuses on understanding user behaviours, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback.
- The goal of user experience research is to prioritize the user. We also want to make sure business needs are met. 
- UX research can help bridge the gap between what a business thinks the user needs and what the user actually needs, before an expensive and time-consuming product is made.

- ***Product development life cycle***: The process used to take a product from an idea to reality.
- User research is a continuous part of the product development life cycle. 
- Research that takes place before anything is designed (Phase 3: design) is usually called foundational research (also called as strategic or generative research.)

**Foundational research**
- Foundational research is always done **before** you start designing. Within the product development life cycle, foundational research happens **during the brainstorm stage** (stage one) to help you empathize with users, understand their needs, and inspire new design directions. During this stage, you will also make **personas and user stories**.
- Methods: Interviews, surveys, Focus groups, Competitive audit, Field studies, and Diary studies.
- Answers the questions:
	- What should we build?
    - What are the user problems?
    - How can we solve them?
- The goal of foundational research is to help define the problem you would like to design a solution for.

**Design reserach (or tactical research)**
- Design research is done **while** you design. Within the product development lifecycle, design research happens during the design stage (stage three) to help inform your designs, to fit the **needs of users**, and to **reduce risk**. Each time you create a new version of your design, new research should be done to evaluate what works well and what needs to be changed.
- Methods: **Usability study**, A/B testing, Cafe or guerrilla studies, Card sorting, and Intercepts
- Answers the questions:
	- How should we build?
    - How was your experience using the prototype today?
    - How easy or difficult was it to use? Why? Did you encounter any challenges? 
- The goal of design research is to inform how the product should be built and reduce the problems that occur as users interact with your prototype.

**Post-launch research**
- Post-launch research is done **after** the design is complete and your product has launched. Within the product development life cycle, post-launch research happens after the launch stage (stage five) to help **validate** that the product is meeting user needs through established metrics.
- Methods: A/B testing, Usability studies, Surveys, and Logs analysis
- Answers the question: 
	- Did we succeed?
- The goal of post-launch research is to understand how users experienced the product and whether it was a good or poor user experience. 
- You might also want to check your product's performance against the competition.
