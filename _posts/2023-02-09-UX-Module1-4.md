## 1. Foundations of User Experience (UX) Design
### Module 4: Integrating research into the design process.

> Learning Objectives

- Identify and account for biases in UX research
- Explain research methods to use during the product development life cycle
- Describe the role of UX research in the design process
- List common research methods in UX design

> Emily - The power of UX research

- "All of the engineers in the back room had a new appreciation for research, for our users, and really learned to empathize with our user through research."

> Introduction to UX research

- ***UX research***: Focuses on understanding user behaviours, needs, and motivations through observation and feedback.
- The goal of user experience research is to prioritize the user. We also want to make sure business needs are met. 
- UX research can help bridge the gap between what a business thinks the user needs and what the user actually needs, before an expensive and time-consuming product is made.

- ***Product development life cycle***: The process used to take a product from an idea to reality.
- User research is a continuous part of the product development life cycle. 
- Research that takes place before anything is designed (Phase 3: design) is usually called foundational research (also called as strategic or generative research.)

**Foundational research**
- Foundational research is always done **before** you start designing. Within the product development life cycle, foundational research happens **during the brainstorm stage** (stage one) to help you empathize with users, understand their needs, and inspire new design directions. During this stage, you will also make **personas and user stories**.
- Methods: Interviews, surveys, Focus groups, Competitive audit, Field studies, and Diary studies.
- Answers the questions:
	- What should we build?
    - What are the user problems?
    - How can we solve them?
- The goal of foundational research is to help define the problem you would like to design a solution for.

**Design reserach (or tactical research)**
- Design research is done **while** you design. Within the product development lifecycle, design research happens during the design stage (stage three) to help inform your designs, to fit the **needs of users**, and to **reduce risk**. Each time you create a new version of your design, new research should be done to evaluate what works well and what needs to be changed.
- Methods: **Usability study**, A/B testing, Cafe or guerrilla studies, Card sorting, and Intercepts
- Answers the questions:
	- How should we build?
    - How was your experience using the prototype today?
    - How easy or difficult was it to use? Why? Did you encounter any challenges? 
- The goal of design research is to inform how the product should be built and reduce the problems that occur as users interact with your prototype.

**Post-launch research**
- Post-launch research is done **after** the design is complete and your product has launched. Within the product development life cycle, post-launch research happens after the launch stage (stage five) to help **validate** that the product is meeting user needs through established metrics.
- Methods: A/B testing, Usability studies, Surveys, and Logs analysis
- Answers the question: 
	- Did we succeed?
- The goal of post-launch research is to understand how users experienced the product and whether it was a good or poor user experience. 
- You might also want to check your product's performance against the competition.

- **Primary research** is research you conduct yourself. Information from direct interactions with users, like interviews, surveys, or usability studies, are considered primary research.

- **Secondary research** is research that uses information someone else has put together. For example, using information from sources like books, articles, or journals is considered secondary research.

- **Qualitative research** is primarily collected through observations and conversations. Qualitative research is based on understanding users’ needs and aims to answer questions like “why” or “how did this happen?”

- **Quantitative research** focuses on data that can be gathered by counting or measuring. Quantitative research is based on numerical data that’s often collected from large-scale surveys. This type of research aims to answer questions like “how many?” and “how much?”

- All four of these types of research can intermix. Primary and secondary research can be both qualitative and quantitative. For example, an interview is qualitative research. An interview conducted by you is primary research. If you review an article about an interview conducted by someone else, it’s secondary research. 

> Understand benefits and drawbacks of research methods

- The search method we choose depends on the question we're trying to answer. 

**Secondary Research**
- If we're just getting started with a project, we might use secondary research to know the stats, facts, and figures that **already exist** about our users.
- Benefits
	- Saves time and money
    - Immediately accessible
    - Backs up primary research
- Drawbacks
	- No first-hand user interaction
    - No specific user feedback

**Interviews**
- Interviews are a research method used to collect in-depth information on people's opinions, thoughts, experiences, and feelings. Interviews can be performed one-on-one or in a group setting, like a focus group. 
- Interviews can take the form of qualitative and quantitative research. A qualitative research method includes open-ended questions that require participants to explain their answers by providing more details. A quantitative research method includes only close-ended questions, like questions that require only “yes”  or “no” responses or set multiple choice questions. 
- Benefits
	- Understand what users thinka and why
	- An opportunity to ask follow-up questions 
- Drawbacks
	-Take a lot of time and money. 
    - This means you'll end up with a small sample size, which can be risky when launching a brand new product.

**Surveys**
- A survey is an activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product
- You can design surveys to include open-ended questions for qualitative research, which allow research participants to clarify their survey responses, as well as close-ended questions for quantitative research, which generate numerical data. 
- Benefits
	- Larger sample size
    - Fast
    - Inexpensive
- Drawbacks
	- Lack of in-depth feedback

**Usability studies**
- A usability study is a technique used to evaluate a product by testing it on users. Usability studies help demonstrate if a product is on the right track or if the design needs to be adjusted.
- Qualitative research is based on observations, and a critical part of conducting usability studies is observing how participants interact with the product you’ve designed. Quantitative research can also be used when conducting usability studies to understand participants’ impressions of the product.
- Benefits
	- Firsthand user interaction
    - Challenge our assumptions
    - In-depth feedback
- Drawbacks
	- Only measure how easy a product is to use
    - Expensive
    - Difference in lab use versus real life

> Identify types of bias in UX research

- Bias: Favouring or having prejudice against something based on limited information.

- confirmation bias: Occurs when you start looking for evidence to prove a hypothesis you have. 
	- Overcoming confirmation bias
    	- Ask open-ended questions
        - Actively listen
        - Includee a large sample of users
- false consensus bias: Happens when we overestimate the number of people who will agree with our idea or design, which creates a false consensus. 
	- Overcoming false consensus bias
    	- Identify and articulate your own assumptions
		- For example, you might live in a community that often identifies with certain political beliefs. When you meet a new person, you might assume they share your political beliefs, because you both live in the same town. 
     - Survey large groups of people
- primacy bias: Remember the first participant most strongly
- recency bias: It's easiest to remember the last thing you heard
	- Overcoming primacy bias & recency bias
    	- Take detailed notes or recordings for each interview or conversation
        - Interview each participant in the same way
- implicit bias: The collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate to people without our conscious knowledge. For example, implicit bias might cause you to feel uncomfortable interviewing people whose life experiences are different from your own.
	- Overcoming implicit bias
    	- Reflect on our own behaviours
        - Ask others to point out our implicit bias
- sunk cost fallacy: The deeper we get into a project we've invested in, the harder it is to change course
	- Overcoming sunk cost fallacy
    	- Break down your proejct into smaller phases
        - Outline points where you can decide whether to continue or stop

> Preventing bias in data collection

- Choose your words carefully. While conducting research, it’s important to use words that don’t lead the user in one direction or another. 
- Choosing leading words can cause the **framing effect**, where users make a decision or choice based on the way information was presented to them. 
- This is especially critical in usability studies. For example, imagine a participant is testing your designs. You ask the participant: “Do you like or dislike the improved layout of these buttons?” Because you used the word “improved,” the user will most likely reply positively. But, this isn’t very useful feedback because you framed the question in a way that led the participant to respond accordingly. To improve your product, you need honest feedback.

- Foster independent thinking. Group interviews can be affected by the **bandwagon effect**, or going along with the group’s opinion instead of thinking creatively, which can discourage open discussion by people who have an opinion that doesn’t align with the majority of the group. 
- To combat the bandwagon effect, ask participants to write down or record their thoughts before discussing as a group.

- Avoid specific language. It’s important to be mindful about the types of questions you ask users and how those questions are framed. You’ll need to be careful to avoid **confirmation bias**, which is trying to find evidence to prove a hypothesis you already have. 
- Confirmation bias is particularly prevalent in online surveys. Remember, in a survey, you want measurable results, which is known as quantitative data. 

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/2c2d244b-0edb-4ae0-8c66-e6e70d91da31/image.png)
- Limit the guidance you give users. Everyone learns and thinks in different ways. When you’re conducting any type of UX research, you have to be cautious to avoid experiencing any **false consensus**, which is the assumption that others will think the same way as you do. 
- It’s important to let participants follow their own paths through your product, without interrupting them. Instead, ask participants to narrate or break down their user journey with your product, as they move through the flow. 

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/ff97eff9-cdb1-4b58-8bea-a6ef58b28a51/image.png)
- Consider users’ tone and body language. To avoid experiencing **implicit biases**, which are based on the collection of attitudes and stereotypes you associate with people without your conscious knowledge, it’s important to clarify when you think you’re getting mixed signals from a participant. 

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/91e7794f-317d-49d2-aad9-ce68c6ec4f8f/image.png)
- Be careful of your own body language and reactions. You also have to be mindful of your own tone and body language while interacting with participants. **Social desirability bias** can happen when a participant answers a question based on what they think you want to hear.
- For example, imagine you’re describing a feature of the app you’ve designed that really excites you, and your tone of voice changes. If this happens, it’s likely that the participant won’t be honest about their negative opinions of the feature, since you’re so positive about it.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/868a22b9-c75f-467d-8c78-f7fa47021988/image.png)
- Plan your research effectively. Tight deadlines are inevitable. But as a UX designer, it’s essential you get enough time to recruit the right users for your research. **Availability bias** occurs when you rush the user recruitment process or skip screener questions to attract a bigger pool of users, even if they don’t fit the qualifications or characteristics that you’ve already determined are present in your ideal user. 

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/ff84756e-b969-4a58-8a87-13c63d149af0/image.png)
- Remain open minded. One more tip: When you’re conducting research, you have to work hard to treat all information equally to avoid both **primacy bias**, and **recency bias**. 
- To help combat these biases in your own research, it’s helpful to space out the scheduling of interviews, ask your colleagues to join you during interviews to provide additional opinions, and take careful notes.
