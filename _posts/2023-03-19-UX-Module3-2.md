## 3. Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Prototypes
### Module 2: Creating paper and digital wireframes

> Learning Objectives
	- Use information architecture to organize a mobile app
	- Create paper wireframes
	- Create digital wireframes in Figma
	- Explain how Gestalt principles apply to wireframes

### Understand information architecture

> The basic of information architecture (IA)

- Information architecture(IA): Organizes content to help users understand where they are in a product and where the information they want is
- Here's an example of how IA might come to life:

- Importance of information architecture
	- Organizes and defines the overall structure for the app or site
    - Provides a high-level of a product
    - Helps stakeholders review your designs
    - Helps enginners understnad how to organize the data
    - Allows your ideas to grow and iterate with the design

> Designing the information architecture of apps

- Information architecture is made up of three pieces:
1) Organization: The organization is how different pieces of information connect in a product.
2) Hierarchy: The hierarchy is often called the “tree structure” and is where a larger category is placed at the top and specific categories related to the overall category are placed underneath. Peer information is placed side by side (or on the same level as each other).
3) Sequence: The sequence enables users to move through an app via certain orders or steps.

- Eight basic principles
- These are principles created by the founder of EightShapes, Dan Brown. They were created to help UX designers understand and make decisions about their products. Here’s a list of the eight principles: <br/>
	1) Object principle: You should view your content as "living" and as something that changes and grows over time.<br/>
  2) Choice principle: People think they want to habe many choices, but they actually need fewer choices that are well-organized<br/>
  3) Disclosure principle: information should not be unexpected or unnecessary<br/>
  4) Exemplar principle: Humans put things into categories and group different concepts together.<br/>
	5) Front door principle: People will usually arrive at a homepage from another website.<br/>
	6) Multiple classification principle: People have different ways of searching for information.<br/>
	7) Focused navigation principle: There must be a strategy and logic behind the way navigation menus are designed.<br/>
	8) Growth principle: The amount of content in a design will grow over time.<br/>

- **Information architecture principles for building a great sitemap.**
	- The final step in the information architecture process that we'll walk through is site mapping.
    - The hierachical connection between content is often referred to the UX field as a "parent/child" connection.
- **Web app sitemaps**
	1. Homepage, homescreen, or starting point: The homepage is usually the first point of entry for a user. For example, the first entry point for an app might be the welcome page. The “parent” for this page would be “welcome page.” The “child” connection might be: new user log-in, returning user log-in, or log in with Facebook or Google (these are peers and sit on the same level).

	2. Other relevant screens: Other relevant pages would include all the other parent/child relationships in the app. An example of this is when a user goes to the parent screen to Settings; under that, the child connections might be Profile, Security, Help, and Policies. Another example is when a user goes to the parent screen to tap Help on an app; under Help, the child connections might be Search for a help topic, Browse topics, and Contact us. 

- **Mobile app sitemaps**
	- This stucture is similar for a mobile app; you should include high-level entry points for users. 
    - Do not use as many categories on a sitemap for a mobile app as a sitemap for a web app

	1. Homepage, Product Features, User Settings, Pricing, Contact Us, and Help.
	2. Underneath those high-level categories are child connections. For example, Name, Email Address, and Payment Details would be included under User Profile.
    - The challenges that come with creating information architecture for a mobile app are to 
    	1) consider ways to focus on the essential content and eliminate or move around less important content,
        2) consider the size and spacing of any touchscreen targets 3) consider ways to make sure the mobile text will be large enough.

> Create paper wireframes

- Benefits of paper wireframs
	- Fast
    - Inexpensive
    - Explore lots of ideas
    - Narrow our focus

### Create digital wireframes

> Transition from paper to digital wireframes

- **Moving from paper to digital wireframes**
	- Is my paper wireframe complete?
    - Have I received feedback on my paper wireframe?
    - Am I ready to consider basic visual cues?

- **Transition to digital wireframes**
	- Use actual content for important pieces of text
    	- For example, you might list the actual text label below the icons to make it clear what each icon will do. But for large chunks of body copy, use a placeholder text like Lorem ipsum.
        * Lorem ipsum: Meaningless placeholder text written in Latin that you can use to show where content will go and how a poage will be laid out,
     - Hold back on adding expressive content
    	- Focus on functions rather than colours and images

- **Benefits of digital wireframes**
     - Pay more attention to the details. The goal of paper wireframes was to get all of your ideas out on paper.
   	 - Easier to share than paper wireframes, because many digital tools, like the ones we'll use, allow you to collaborate

### Use Gestalt Principles in wireframes

> Use Gestalt Principles when creating wireframes

- **Gestalt principles**
	- Similarity: Elements that look similar are perceived to have the same function
    - Proximity: Elements that are close together appear to be more related than things that are spaced farther apart
    - Common region: Elements located within the same area are perceived to be grouped together
- Gestalt principles: How humans group similar elements, recognize patterns, and. simplify complex images when we perceive objects

- First, **similarity** is key when it comes to your wireframes. 
- To help users navigate your app quickly, you want to keep “like with like” for consistency. 
	- For example, if you’re including avatars or images of users in the design of your app, you’ll want to make sure that the placeholders for those avatars are the same shape and size in your wireframes. This similarly indicates to users that the elements have the same function — in this case, linking to profiles of users.

- Secondly,the Gestalt Principle of **proximity**. Alternatively, if you leave a lot of space between the text of the article and the “learn more” button, users might not understand the connection between the two elements. 
- A few seconds of confusion or hesitation can mean the difference between a user continuing to the next page of your app or closing it to find something more useful.

- Lastly, the Gestalt Principle of **common region**. 
- By creating a border and adding a block of color to a navigation bar, you can anchor the icons for the main pages of your app, instead of having the icons float on the screen. 
- This design tip helps users recognize that the icons in the navigation bar are more important than others and are perceived to be grouped together.
