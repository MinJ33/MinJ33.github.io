> The basics of design critique sessions

- **Design critique session**: A planned period of time where UX designers present their work to team members and listen to feedback
- In a design critique, participants can play one of three main roles: Facilitaor, presenter, or a viewer.
	- **Facilitaor**: Run the critique session and guide the process
    - **Presenter**: The designer who is sharing their work with others in the session
    - **Reviewer**: Gives feedback about the design and offers clear actions to take
    - **Notetaker**: Captures all of the ideas and feedback from the reviewers

- **Example of a structure that a design critique session might follow**
	- The facilitator provides an overview of the design critique session and defines the objectives, or the goals of the design critique
	- The presenter shares their design work
	- Reviewers take turns explaining their feedback
    - Facilitator wraps up the crit session
