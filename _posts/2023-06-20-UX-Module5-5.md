## 5. Create High-Fidelity Designs and Prototypes in Figma
### Module 5: Creating High-Fidelity prototypes

> Learning Objectives
	- Differentiate between low-fidelity and high-fidelity prototypes
	- Recognize accessibility considerations when designing with motion
	- Describe how to apply gestures and motion to prototypes in Figma
	- Identify common use cases for applying motion to mobile app designs
	- Define examples of common gestures used to navigate mobile apps
	- Create a high-fidelity prototype from mockup designs in Figma
	- Add motion and gestures to enhance prototypes in Figma

### Understand high-fidelity prototypes

> Intro to high-fidelity prototypes

- **Prototype**: An early model of a product that demonstrates functionality
- **Low-fidelity prototypes**: Interacitve versions of designs that use content placeholders
- **High-fidelity prototypes**: Detailed, interactive versions of designs that closely match the look and feel of the final product
	- They have: Visual elements, Navigation, Interaction

### Explore gestures and motion

> Gestures and motion in UX design

- **Gesture**: Any method of interaction a user has with information on their device using touch
	- Swipe, Tap, Drag, Pinch
- **Motion**: A way to animate static design elements to focus the user's attention and tell stories
- Motion can make apps and websites more engaging and easier to use, like drawing attention to the focal point of a website or seeing a menu disappear as you drag it closed.
