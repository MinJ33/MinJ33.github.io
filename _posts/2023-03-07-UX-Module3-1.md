## 3. Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Prototypes
### Module 1: Storyboarding and wireframing

> Learning Objectives
- Build a goal statement
- Outline a user flow
- Create big picture and close-up storyboards, and understand when to use each type
- Explain the difference between low-fidelity and high-fidelity design
- Describe the purpose of wireframing in the design process
- Apply the basics of drawing

> Use reseach to inform ideation

- Empathy map: An easily understood chart that explains everything designers have learned about a type of user
- It focuses on four main motivations of users:

- Personas: Fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users

- User story: Fictional one-sentence story told from a persona's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions
- If you have a lot of user needs to consider, user stories determine which ones are the most critical to resolve. This can help narrow down which user needs to focus on when coming up with ideas for solutions.

- User journey: The series of experience a user has as they interact with your product

- Together, empathy maps, personas, user stories, and user journey maps help us create a problem statement, or a clear description of a user's needs that our design should address.

> Revisit problem statements

- As a reminder, a problem statement is a clear description of the user’s need that should be addressed. 
- A problem statement includes a fictional user’s name, characteristics, their needs, and a key insight gained from your research. You can use this template to create a problem statement:

- In the case of Jake, the persona I created, this problem statement would be created like this: 
Jake is a high school student who needs clear and easily accessible details on promotions and events provided by the amusement park's website because he wants to plan the perfect day out for his younger sisters and save money, but the website's lack of organization and information is causing frustration and making it difficult for him to plan effectively.

### Build goal statements

> Create goal statements

- Product goal statement: One or two sentences that describe a product and its benefits for the user
- Goal statement
	- What the product lets users do
    - Who the action affects
    - Why the action positively affects users
    - How the effectiveness of the prodcut is measured

> Learn more about goal statements

- A **goal statement** provides the ideal solution for your design challenge.
- Goal statements cover who the product will serve, what the product will do, and why the product solves the user’s need. 

**1. Revisit your problems statement**

_Jake_ is a _high school student_ who needs _clear and easily accessible details on promotions and events provided by the amusement park's website_ because _he wants to plan the perfect day out for his younger sisters and save money, but the website's lack of organization and information is causing frustration and making it difficult for him to plan effectively._


**2. Transition from identifying the problem to defining the goal**
- At this point, it's time to transition from the problem that users are facing to the solution we can design to meet their needs. 
- This can be a single, specific goal or a greater idea that you’ve chosen to be the focus of your design.
- A strong goal statement:
	- Describes a specific action users can take or what the product will do. 
	- Defines who the action will affect. 
	- States the positive impact of the action or why the product solves the user's need.
	- Outlines success in measurable terms.

Our **amusement park app** will let users, **easily access and navigate the app to find clear and detailed information on promotions and events to plan the perfect day out for their families,** which will positively affect **their overall experience and save them money.** We will measure effectiveness by **tracking user engagement and feedback on the availability and accessibility of information, as well as the number of users who successfully redeem promotions through the app.**

### Outline user flows

> Introduction to user flows

- The path taken by a typical user on an app or a webiste, so they can complete a task from start to finish.
- They include shapes that represent different interactions. 
- For example,
![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/69add231-752b-4806-a077-8c8b6dba9056/image.png)
    **Circles** indicate the **actions** users take when moving through a product design. 
    **Rectangles** indicate the **screens** of a digital product that users will experience while completing tasks. 
    **Diamonds** symbolize the **decisions** users make and either move them forward through the flow or back to an earlier part of the flow. 
    **lines** provide **user flow direction** through the user flow based on each user's decision.

### Create storyboards

> Introduction to storyboarding user flows

- Storyboard: A series of panels or frames that visually describe and explore a user's experience with a product
- Four elements of a storyboard:
	- Character: The user in your story
    - Scene: Helps us imagine the user's environment
    - Plot: The benefit or solution of the design
    - Narrative: The user's need or problem and how the design will solve the problem

> Understand the two types of storyboards

- 1) Big picture storyboard(How & Why)
	- Focuses on the user experience
    - Shows the emotional engagement that a user will have with our app or with any product. 
    - Understanding how a user feels while experiencing your product is an essential part of the design process
- 2) Close-up storyboard (What)
	-Focuses on the product
	- he close-up storyboard is less about emotion, instead it is focused on the practicalities of the design itself. 
- So how do you decide which type of storyboard to use?
	- If you're early in the design process, you might want to present your high-level ideas to stakeholders to get them excited and bought in. 
    - In this case, a big-picture storyboard makes sense. so your team can focus on the user, their needs, and their experience with your product.
	- On the other hand, a close-up storyboard is more useful after your initial design directions have been explored.
    - Since a close-up storyboard focuses on the details within your product, like screens of an app, this type of storyboard can help you think through practical ideas about improving the product

[Creating a big picture storyboard]

**Pro tip: Remember that big picture storyboards focus on the user experience.** The storyboard should show how people use your product and why your product will be helpful to them. Because big picture storyboards are about the user, it's **important to include emotion** by using a sad or happy face, for example, at different steps of the journey to make the storyboard feel human and relatable. 

1. **Start with a problem statement.** This will help establish character and set the scene for your storyboard. 
For this example, the problem statement might be:

2. **Create a goal statement.** Your goal statement helps you determine a plot (the benefit or solution of your design) for your storyboard. 
A goal statement for this example might be:

3. **Set up the storyboard**
![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/2428829a-5e0a-41ec-95b7-bf558429fd50/image.png)
4. **Add the storyboard scenario.** Begin filling out the storyboard template by adding the scenario. At the top of the template, write a sentence that sets the narrative for the storyboard. 
5. **Draw one idea per panel.** The first panel is used to set the scene for the story. Then with each additional panel, think about actions that push the story forward and how the user feels in each pane
6. **Expose pain points for the user along their journey.**
7. **Include the user goal or conclusion in the final panel.**

[Create a close-up storyboard]
To create a close-up storyboard, **steps 1-4 are the same** as the big picture storyboard process:
1. Start with a problem statement. 
2. Create a goal statement. 
3. Set up the storyboard.
4. Add the storyboard scenario. 
5. Draw one idea per panel. Remember, big picture storyboards focus on the user, while close-up storyboards focus on the product.
