## 3. Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Prototypes
### Module 1: Storyboarding and wireframing

> Learning Objectives

- Outline a user flow
- Create big picture and close-up storyboards, and understand when to use each type
- Explain the difference between low-fidelity and high-fidelity design

- Personas: Fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users

- User story: Fictional one-sentence story told from a persona's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions
- If you have a lot of user needs to consider, user stories determine which ones are the most critical to resolve. This can help narrow down which user needs to focus on when coming up with ideas for solutions.

- User journey: The series of experience a user has as they interact with your product

- Together, empathy maps, personas, user stories, and user journey maps help us create a problem statement, or a clear description of a user's needs that our design should address.
