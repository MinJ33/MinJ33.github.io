## 3. Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Prototypes
### Module 1: Storyboarding and wireframing

> Learning Objectives
- Build a goal statement
- Outline a user flow
- Create big picture and close-up storyboards, and understand when to use each type
- Explain the difference between low-fidelity and high-fidelity design
- Describe the purpose of wireframing in the design process
- Apply the basics of drawing

> Use reseach to inform ideation

- Empathy map: An easily understood chart that explains everything designers have learned about a type of user
- It focuses on four main motivations of users:

- Personas: Fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users

- User story: Fictional one-sentence story told from a persona's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions
- If you have a lot of user needs to consider, user stories determine which ones are the most critical to resolve. This can help narrow down which user needs to focus on when coming up with ideas for solutions.

- User journey: The series of experience a user has as they interact with your product

- Together, empathy maps, personas, user stories, and user journey maps help us create a problem statement, or a clear description of a user's needs that our design should address.

> Revisit problem statements

- As a reminder, a problem statement is a clear description of the user’s need that should be addressed. 
- A problem statement includes a fictional user’s name, characteristics, their needs, and a key insight gained from your research. You can use this template to create a problem statement:

- In the case of Jake, the persona I created, this problem statement would be created like this: 
Jake is a high school student who needs clear and easily accessible details on promotions and events provided by the amusement park's website because he wants to plan the perfect day out for his younger sisters and save money, but the website's lack of organization and information is causing frustration and making it difficult for him to plan effectively.

### Build goal statements

> Create goal statements

- Product goal statement: One or two sentences that describe a product and its benefits for the user
- Goal statement
	- What the product lets users do
    - Who the action affects
    - Why the action positively affects users
    - How the effectiveness of the prodcut is measured

> Learn more about goal statements

- A **goal statement** provides the ideal solution for your design challenge.
- Goal statements cover who the product will serve, what the product will do, and why the product solves the user’s need. 

**1. Revisit your problems statement**

_Jake_ is a _high school student_ who needs _clear and easily accessible details on promotions and events provided by the amusement park's website_ because _he wants to plan the perfect day out for his younger sisters and save money, but the website's lack of organization and information is causing frustration and making it difficult for him to plan effectively._


**2. Transition from identifying the problem to defining the goal**
- At this point, it's time to transition from the problem that users are facing to the solution we can design to meet their needs. 
- This can be a single, specific goal or a greater idea that you’ve chosen to be the focus of your design.
- A strong goal statement:
	- Describes a specific action users can take or what the product will do. 
	- Defines who the action will affect. 
	- States the positive impact of the action or why the product solves the user's need.
	- Outlines success in measurable terms.

Our **amusement park app** will let users, **easily access and navigate the app to find clear and detailed information on promotions and events to plan the perfect day out for their families,** which will positively affect **their overall experience and save them money.** We will measure effectiveness by **tracking user engagement and feedback on the availability and accessibility of information, as well as the number of users who successfully redeem promotions through the app.**
