### Plan a usability study

> Plan and Conduct a UX research study

- **Research plan**: A step-by-step examination of a group of users and their needs
- **Usability study**: A research method that assesses how easy it is for participants to complete core tasks in a product
- **Moderated usability study**: A person guides pariticpants through the study in real time
- **Unmoderated usability study**: Participants test out the prototypes wihout a moderator present
- **Why conduct multiple usability studies?**
	- Because your product looks and functions differently at every stage, you can conduct as many usaubility studies as you need to make changes to your design and improve the user experience.
    - You can conduct usability studies at any point in the design process.

### Iterate on high-fidelity designs
