## Weekly Challenge 4: Research in the design process

1. What is the goal of UX research?
- Prioritizing the user

2. A design team is developing a new product and they want to understand how to build it. Which type of research can best help the team answer their question?
- Design

3. Imagine that a UX designer creates an app for saving, organizing, and streaming podcasts. To learn about users' experiences with their product, the designer conducts interviews with a select group of target users: podcast enthusiasts. The research team has a hypothesis that podcast enthusiasts prefer long-form, polished content—rather than talk radio and news—so they ask a series of questions about how users interact with this content. 

How can the researcher avoid the impact of confirmation bias? Select all that apply.

- Ask open-ended questions and actively listen to respondents
- Interview a large group of users with diverse perspectives

> One of the most effective methods for overcoming confirmation bias is to ask open-ended questions. This lets the person being interviewed answer freely instead of with a “yes” or “no” response. The researcher can also include a large sample of users with diverse perspectives.

### Test your knowledge on UX research methods

1. Which research method is best suited for the following scenario?

Team Donut is developing an app that allows users to navigate grocery stores and find in-stock items with ease. The demographic of users who use similar applications on the market will influence how Team Donut approaches the app’s interface design. Team Donut would like a large sample size of data. 
- Surveys

> A survey is an activity where many people are asked the same questions in order to understand what most people think about a product. They allow a team to assess from a larger sample size and gather insight quickly. It’s typically less expensive and less time-consuming than a few other methods, including interviews.
