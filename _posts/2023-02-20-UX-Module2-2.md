- For example: As a online shopper, I want to receive a text when the item arrives, so that I can pick it up right away.
- This user story is complete with a type of user, action, and benefit. A complete user story keeps the problem user-centered, actionable, and clear.

- As a type of user (who), I want to action (what) so that benefit (why).
- ex) As a busy executive, I want to trust that dog walkers won't stand me up so I can work worry-free.
- Personas and user stories represent the needs of the users you’re designing for. 
- The more detailed and accurate your personas and user stories are, the better you will be at designing products that meet their needs. 

> Consider edge cases

- Happy path: A user story with a happy ending
- When a user stays on the happy path in a user story, the user reaches their goal without issue because everything goes as expected.

- Edge case: A rare situation or unexpected problem that interrupts a standard user experience
- An edge case is a situation within a product experience that the product team doesn't think it's very likely to happen, or that is outside of the typical flow within that product.
- In edge cases, the obstacle is often beyond the user's control to fix

**Spotting & resolving edge cases**
- Create personas and user stories
- Thoroughly review the project before launch
- Use wireframes

> Create a user journey map

- User journey: The series of experiences a user has as they achieve a specific goal

**Benefits of user journey mapping**
- Helps UX designers create obstable-free paths for users
- Reduces impact of designer bias
- Highlights new pain points
- Identifies improvement opportunities
- Examples of user journey map:

> Consider accessibility when empathizing

- **Accessibility** is not just designing to include a group of users with varying abilities.
- Designing for accessibility is about considering all users’ journeys, keeping their permanent, temporary, or situational disabilities in mind. 
	- Betty, a user with only one arm;
	- Angela, a user with a sprained wrist;
    - Juan, a user holding a colicky newborn
	- Betty's disability is permanent, Angela's is temporary, and Juan's is situational, but they all need to achieve their user goal with only one hand
