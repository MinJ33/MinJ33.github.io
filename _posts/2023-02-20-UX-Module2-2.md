## 2. Start the UX Design Process: Empathize, Define, and Ideate
### Module 2: Creating user stories and user journey maps

> Learning Objectives
- Create user stories
- Create a user journey map
- Explain the importance of accessible and inclusive design

> User story

- User story: A fictional one-sentence story told from the persona's point of view to inspire and inform design decisions.
- **Advantages** of user stories
	- prioritze design goals
    - Unite the team
    - Inspire empathetic desgin decisions
    - Personalize pitchees to stakeholders

- A simple formula to write a user story:

- For example: As a online shopper, I want to receive a text when the item arrives, so that I can pick it up right away.
- This user story is complete with a type of user, action, and benefit. A complete user story keeps the problem user-centered, actionable, and clear.

- As a type of user (who), I want to action (what) so that benefit (why).
- ex) As a busy executive, I want to trust that dog walkers won't stand me up so I can work worry-free.
- Personas and user stories represent the needs of the users you’re designing for. 
- The more detailed and accurate your personas and user stories are, the better you will be at designing products that meet their needs. 

> Consider edge cases

- Happy path: A user story with a happy ending
- When a user stays on the happy path in a user story, the user reaches their goal without issue because everything goes as expected.

- Edge case: A rare situation or unexpected problem that interrupts a standard user experience
- An edge case is a situation within a product experience that the product team doesn't think it's very likely to happen, or that is outside of the typical flow within that product.
- In edge cases, the obstacle is often beyond the user's control to fix

**Spotting & resolving edge cases**
- Create personas and user stories
- Thoroughly review the project before launch
- Use wireframes

> Create a user journey map

- User journey: The series of experiences a user has as they achieve a specific goal

**Benefits of user journey mapping**
- Helps UX designers create obstable-free paths for users
- Reduces impact of designer bias
- Highlights new pain points
- Identifies improvement opportunities
- Examples of user journey map:

> Consider accessibility when empathizing

- **Accessibility** is not just designing to include a group of users with varying abilities.
- Designing for accessibility is about considering all users’ journeys, keeping their permanent, temporary, or situational disabilities in mind. 
	- Betty, a user with only one arm;
	- Angela, a user with a sprained wrist;
    - Juan, a user holding a colicky newborn
	- Betty's disability is permanent, Angela's is temporary, and Juan's is situational, but they all need to achieve their user goal with only one hand

> Consider accessibility during user research

- Here are a few considerations for you to take into account when conducting research during the empathize phase of the design process.

**Touch**
- How would you design for users who have use of one arm, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally?
- Decide where to place buttons within your design based on several different hand sizes.
- Create a feature that allows double taps to avoid accidental icon clicks.
- Enable the one-handed keyboard feature and general keyboard compatibility.
- Allow button customization for easy access to information that the user finds most important.

**See**
- How would you design for users who have limited vision, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally?
- Use a larger font to create a reader-friendly design of the app.
- Ensure the app and the images have alternate text that can be read by a screen reader.
- Detect whether the user is operating a motor vehicle.
- Design the app with high contrast colors.
- Don’t rely on text color to explain navigation or next steps. For example, don’t use red text alone as an indicator of a warning. Instead, your design should include explicit instructions.
+ Customizable text: There are some additional web accessibility tools that individuals with dyslexia or other visual processing disabilities may benefit from. One of these ways is customizable text, a feature that allows users to change how text is displayed in order to read the text more easily.  Text customization involves changing everything from the color or font to the size or even the spacing of the text.

**Hear**
- How would you design for users who have limited hearing, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally? 
- Don’t rely solely on sounds to provide app updates, like a new message notification. Instead, enable haptics, which are vibrations that engage a user’s sense of touch, and notification lights.
- Apply closed captioning to all videos. 
- Provide a text messaging system within the app to allow users to communicate through writing.

**Speak**
- How would you design for users who cannot speak, either permanently, temporarily, or situationally? 
- Provide written intros, descriptions, and instructions for users, in addition to video-based content.
- Provide Real-Time Texting during phone calls with users or with app support.
- Arrange alternatives for automated systems that rely on speech recognition.
- Provide an in-app messaging system that allows the use of emojis and image uploads.
