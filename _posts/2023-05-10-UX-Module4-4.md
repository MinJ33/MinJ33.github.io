>  Organize insights for sharing

- Insights: Observations about people that help you understand the user or their needs from new perspectives 

> Choose a format for sharing insights

- Two common formats to share your research insights:
- **Presentation**: A group of slides, where each slide has new information

- **Research report**: A document with fewer visuals, containing the same information as the presentation

> Create a strong presentation

- Then, add the date of the presentation and fill in the names of all of team members who worked on the usability study with me

- The project background explains what led you to conduct this research, including why the insights were needed and what impact they will have on decisions being made
- For example: We're creating a new app to helpp people find and schedule dog walkers. We need to find out if the main user experience, finding and scheduling a dog walker, is easy for users to complete

- Research insights is helpful to prioritize your research insights from the most urgent to the least urgent
- **Prioritize research insights from the most urgent to the least urgent**
- P0 = Must be fixed for your product to work
	- Prevented the user from completing the main user flow
    - Deceptive pattern
    - Inequitable or inaccessible
- P1 = Include in a future prototype to be tested
- P2 = Address farther in the future
