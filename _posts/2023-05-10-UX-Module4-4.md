## 4. Conduct UX Research and Test Early Concepts
### Module 4: Sharing research insights for better designs

> Learning Objectives
	
  - Modify low-fidelity designs based on research insights
	- Create a UX research study presentation
	- Develop persuasive presentation skills to share research insights
	- Determine which research insights to apply to designs
	- Apply best practices for organizing and sharing insights
	- Explain how to present user research in an actionable way
	- Explain the importance of crafting persuasive messages

### Understanding research sharing methods

>  Organize insights for sharing

- Insights: Observations about people that help you understand the user or their needs from new perspectives 

> Choose a format for sharing insights

- Two common formats to share your research insights:
- **Presentation**: A group of slides, where each slide has new information

- **Research report**: A document with fewer visuals, containing the same information as the presentation

> Create a strong presentation

- The title can be simple and straightforward
- Then, add the date of the presentation and fill in the names of all of team members who worked on the usability study with me

- The project background explains what led you to conduct this research, including why the insights were needed and what impact they will have on decisions being made
- For example: We're creating a new app to helpp people find and schedule dog walkers. We need to find out if the main user experience, finding and scheduling a dog walker, is easy for users to complete

- For example:

- Research insights is helpful to prioritize your research insights from the most urgent to the least urgent
- **Prioritize research insights from the most urgent to the least urgent**
- P0 = Must be fixed for your product to work
	- Prevented the user from completing the main user flow
    - Deceptive pattern
    - Inequitable or inaccessible
- P1 = Include in a future prototype to be tested
- P2 = Address farther in the future

### Change designs using new insights

>  Modify low-fidelity designs based on insights

- In addition to priority 0, you might have priority 1 and priority 2. 
- An example of an insight that might be categorized as priority 1. 
- During the usability study on the dog walking app, many participants said they wanted to be able to make a reoccurring appointment with a dog walker. Since participants shared this pain point, you could consider this as priority 1 or P1. 
	- One reason you might not consider it a priority 0 is that even without the recurring appointment feature, the user can still complete the main flow in the app. You could reason that the extra ability to make a reoccurring appointment with the dog walker would improve the user experience and therefore could be considered a P1 to include in a future prototype to be tested. 
- If your team ends up with lots of priority 1 insights, you may choose to further categorize these insights by adding another bucket called priority 2. 
	- For example, you and your team might review a list of ten insights that you initially categorized as priority 1 and identify which of these insights to address this month, which would stay as priority 1 versus next month which would become priority 2.

> How to make research-based design changes

- Low-fideliy designs before usability study

- Insight #1: Make it possible to schedule a dog walker on a recurring basis

- Insight #2: Make it easier to pick a date when scheduling a dog walker

- Insight #3: Add a confirmation page beofre the book a dog walker page
