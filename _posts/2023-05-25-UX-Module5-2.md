## 5. Create High-Fidelity Designs and Prototypes in Figma
### Module 2: Applying visual design principles to mockups

> Learning Objectives
	- Apply principles of scale and proportion to elements in mockups
	- Apply principles of unity and variety to elements in mockups
	- Apply Gestalt Principles to refine design elements
	- Distinguish between Gestalt Principles of similarity, proximity, and common region
	- Define the principles of unity and variety
	- Define the principles of scale and proportion
	- Apply principles of visual hierarchy to elements in mockups

### Apply visual design principles to mockups (part 1)

> Emphasis in UX design

- **Emphasis**: Something that attracts attention
- **Visual weight**: A measure of the force that an element exerts to attract the eye
- **Deciding what to emphasize**
	- Where do I want to draw the user's attention?
    - What are the user's goals?

> Use emphasis in mockups

- **Emphasis** means that an object or element is attracting attention. 
- When part of a design has emphasis, the user’s eye is drawn there when they look at an app screen or webpage.

- **Size**
- Implementing changes to the size of elements in your designs is an easy way to provide emphasis for users by drawing their attention to larger objects while simultaneously conveying that one object is more important than another.

- **Contrast**
- Contrast is the creation of opposing visual elements to convey emphasis or comparison. Contrast is a great way to draw emphasis to elements in a design that are different or important. 
- In the image, the checkout cart and "order" buttons are colored bright red and purple which contrasts with the otherwise white and gray app.

- **Texture**
- Texture is the elements within an object that add depth or a pattern to an object. Texture can make an object stand out from other objects within a design and should be used sparingly to draw the user’s gaze.

> Hierarchy in UX design

- Hierarchy: A visual design principle that orders elements on a page and highlihts them by their importance
- **Hierarchy** refers to a group of elements that are organized in order of importance
- **Emphasis** is about making one element stand out from the other elements surrounding it

- The headlines are the elements that stand out on the page because they have the most importance
- Below the headline is a summary of the story, which usually has a font that is smaller and less bold

**Why we need hierarchy Make it clear to the user:**
	- Where to focus first
    - What action to take
**More important information = More visually prominent**

- Accessibility annotations create a visual hierarchy by indicating the order that elements on a screen should be read

### Apply visual design principles to mockups (part 2)

> Scale and proportion in UX design

**Scale**: Explains the size relationship between a given element and the other elements in the design
- Scale helps to create visual hierarchy

- **The importance of scale**
	- Create emphasis
    - Show similarity and contrast
    - Communicate visual hierarchy

**Proportion**: The balance or harmony between elements that are scaled

- **Scale** is a concept that’s used to explain the size relationship between a given element and the other elements in the design. 
- **Proportion** is about the balance or harmony between elements that are scaled. 

> Unity and variety in UX design

- **Unity**: Measures how well elements of your design work together to communicate an idea
- As you start thinking about unity for use throughout your products, there are a few things that you can look for:
	- How elements align with each other
	- The shape of elements 
	- Continuity within text elements
- **Variety**: Varying the elements in your design to break up monotony

- Did I use colours in a consistent and purposeful way?
- Did the typefaces I used work well together?
- Is there enough variety to keep my design interesing?

> Apply visual design priciples to your portfolio project (Refine your visual design)

- Emphasis: Make certain elements stand out from others around them in your design. Apply greater visual weight to what you want the user to notice first to help them complete their task.

- Hierarchy: Assign prominence to elements that contain important information. The sizing of elements is a great place to start when refining visual hierarchy.

- Scale and proportion: Use the size of elements to show where they are relatively similar or different.

- Unity and variety: Make sure that your design is unified as a whole, but includes enough variety throughout to break up the monotony.
