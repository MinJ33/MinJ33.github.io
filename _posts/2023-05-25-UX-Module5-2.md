### Apply visual design principles to mockups (part 1)

> Emphasis in UX design

- **Emphasis**: Something that attracts attention
- **Visual weight**: A measure of the force that an element exerts to attract the eye
- **Deciding what to emphasize**
	- Where do I want to draw the user's attention?
    - What are the user's goals?

> Use emphasis in mockups

- **Emphasis** means that an object or element is attracting attention. 
- When part of a design has emphasis, the user’s eye is drawn there when they look at an app screen or webpage.

- **Size**
- Implementing changes to the size of elements in your designs is an easy way to provide emphasis for users by drawing their attention to larger objects while simultaneously conveying that one object is more important than another.

- **Contrast**
- Contrast is the creation of opposing visual elements to convey emphasis or comparison. Contrast is a great way to draw emphasis to elements in a design that are different or important. 
- In the image, the checkout cart and "order" buttons are colored bright red and purple which contrasts with the otherwise white and gray app.

- **Texture**
- Texture is the elements within an object that add depth or a pattern to an object. Texture can make an object stand out from other objects within a design and should be used sparingly to draw the user’s gaze.

> Hierarchy in UX design

- Hierarchy: A visual design principle that orders elements on a page and highlihts them by their importance
- **Hierarchy** refers to a group of elements that are organized in order of importance
- **Emphasis** is about making one element stand out from the other elements surrounding it 

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/457c405a-99af-4944-a4c5-770dbed2b31b/image.png)
- The headlines are the elements that stand out on the page because they have the most importance
- Below the headline is a summary of the story, which usually has a font that is smaller and less bold

**Why we need hierarchy Make it clear to the user:**
	- Where to focus first
    - What action to take
**More important information = More visually prominent**

- Accessibility annotations create a visual hierarchy by indicating the order that elements on a screen should be read

### Apply visual design principles to mockups (part 2)

> Scale and proportion in UX design

**Scale**: Explains the size relationship between a given element and the other elements in the design
- Scale helps to create visual hierarchy

- **The importance of scale**
	- Create emphasis
    - Show similarity and contrast
    - Communicate visual hierarchy

**Proportion**: The balance or harmony between elements that are scaled

- **Scale** is a concept that’s used to explain the size relationship between a given element and the other elements in the design. 
- **Proportion** is about the balance or harmony between elements that are scaled. 

> Unity and variety in UX design

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/559ea9ad-5b0e-4e81-a5aa-a85a2e991835/image.png)

- **Unity**: Measures how well elements of your design work together to communicate an idea
- As you start thinking about unity for use throughout your products, there are a few things that you can look for:
	- How elements align with each other
	- The shape of elements 
	- Continuity within text elements
- **Variety**: Varying the elements in your design to break up monotony

- Did I use colours in a consistent and purposeful way?
- Did the typefaces I used work well together?
- Is there enough variety to keep my design interesing?

> Apply visual design priciples to your portfolio project (Refine your visual design)

- Emphasis: Make certain elements stand out from others around them in your design. Apply greater visual weight to what you want the user to notice first to help them complete their task.

- Hierarchy: Assign prominence to elements that contain important information. The sizing of elements is a great place to start when refining visual hierarchy.

- Scale and proportion: Use the size of elements to show where they are relatively similar or different.

- Unity and variety: Make sure that your design is unified as a whole, but includes enough variety throughout to break up the monotony.

### Refine mockup designs

> Apply Gestalt Principles to mockups

- **Gestalt principles**: Describe how humans group similar elements, recognize patterns, and simplify complex images when we perceive objects
- **Gestalt principles include**
	- **Similarity**: Elements that look similar are perceived to have the same function
    - **Proximity**: Elements that are close together appear to be more related than elements that are spaced farther apart
    - **Common region**: Elements located within the same area are perceived to be grouped together
    
- Visual balance: The sense that a design is equally weighted on both sides of its emphasized center

> Learn about additional Gestalt Principles

- Three additional Gestalt Principles: **closure, continuity, and symmetry.**
![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/7fa27025-4f6d-4590-a7d7-eee8070fbd0c/image.png)
- **Closure**
- The Gestalt Principle of closure describes that when a human looks at an incomplete object, they subconsciously complete the image to see a whole, completed object.
![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/a2de3f8d-536b-421d-97d2-9591fa78163c/image.png)
- What about closure in the real world? In the FedEx logo, shown above, there is a subtle example of closure. Can you spot it? Between the E and x, the white space forms an arrow pointing right. 

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/01f294f5-af96-4641-8171-c1b782c38a0d/image.png)
- **Continuity**
- The Gestalt Principle of continuity states that elements that are arranged in a line or on a curve appear to be more related than elements not on the line or curve. 
- In other words, continuity guides a user’s eye from object to object, following a line, and focuses attention to specific parts of the screen. 
![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/18d1ec0b-b5db-4ba3-8a54-55dfae0318df/image.png)
- In the real world, the Gestalt Principle of continuity is often used when showing step-by-step processes and when displaying a list of items that are related to each other. Continuity can also be used in navigation menus, as shown on the website for the United States Postal Service (USPS) in the image

- **Symmetry/Asymmetry**
- The Gestalt Principle of symmetry describes that elements are more visually pleasing when the parts of an object are balanced or are mirror images of each other.
- On the other hand, asymmetry, which is a lack of balance and equality, can emphasize an element's importance and create visual interest

> Reflect on your progress

- **Design review checklist**
	- Detail view
    	- Focusing on the small things first allows you to catch places where you might have made mistakes with elements. 
        - It's helpful to review individual elements like typography, color, and iconography to check if they are consistent throughout your mocks or if they're out of order. 
        - For example, in the dog walker app, when checking my work, I found one icon where it accidentally used orange f18530, even though I used orange fa7b17 throughout the rest of the design.
    - Page-level view
    	- Check if all of the elements on each page are balanced and unified
        - This is also a good time to consider the scale and proportion of the elements within a page.
        ![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/485f05bf-85b6-4ad1-96bb-1cfe9b032825/image.png)

        - For example, when I first created the "book appointment" page of my dog walker app, I indented the bios of each dog walker to try to make their name stand out. However after doing a page-level view, I felt like the bios were out of balance with the rest of the page and decided to align everything on the left instead. 
    - Function-level view
    	- In other words, you need to make sure your designs are operational.
        - Ask yourself questions like, does each page have a way to move forward and backwards? or Is there a button to perform the main action for the page?
    - App-level view
    	- Thinking about your designs from the big picture helps ensure that your product overall looks and functions the way you want

> Consider additional visual design elements and principles

- While **Hue** refers to color families (like red, green, or blue), **Value** is a color’s lightness or darkness. The lightest value of any color is white and the darkest is black (as in the graphic above). 

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/80578aa2-6912-4dd1-a14f-71f1e8ae9560/image.png)
- **Saturation** refers to the intensity and richness of color. Think of the highest saturation as the purest form of a color. 
- For example, red, at its most saturated, is bold and bright. You can soften pure red by lowering the saturation and making it appear more muted. Lowering the saturation all the way would leave you with shades of grey, like a black and white film.
- The saturation you choose depends on how bold you want the colors in your design to be. Highly saturated colors are great for grabbing a user's attention. Think of neon signs, highlighters, and sirens—all of which use intense saturation to emphasize their importance.

- **Orientation** refers to the layout of your design. Orientation often corresponds with the platform or device you are designing for. 
- For example, desktop computers tend to have horizontal (or landscape) orientations, whereas mobile phones and tablets let users alternate between vertical (or portrait) and horizontal orientations. 

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/f770923e-c5df-432c-945e-1519b618d527/image.png)
- **Intrinsic interest** refers to how eye-catching a visual element is to users. Certain design elements, like logos or animations, are meant to grab a user’s attention. 
- For example, in the image above, the chapter title is big and bold, drawing the reader’s focus. The text of the chapter, on the other hand, is smaller and more readable. 

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/90d15196-d9f4-4452-8373-f52d8779d6ed/image.png)
- Perceived physical weight is the illusion of weight and volume that each visual element conveys. When creating elements that simulate objects with physical weight, you’ll want each element’s dimensions to proportionately relate to the others.
