## 3. Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Prototypes
### Module 3: Building low-fidelity prototypes

> Learning Objectives
- Create a paper prototype
- Define the difference between a wireframe and a prototype
- Explain the path from digital wireframes to a digital lo-fi prototype in Figma
- Build a low-fidelity prototype in Figma
- Recognize and avoid implicit bias in design
- Identify common deceptive patterns in UX design
- Understand how to avoid the effects of deceptive patterns

### Create low-fidelity prototypes on paper

> Learn about low-fidelity prototypes

- Prototype: An early model of a product that demonstrates functionality
- Fidelity: How closely a design matches the look-and-feel of the final product
- Low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototype: A simple interactive model that provides a basic idea of what the product would look like

> Create a paper prototype

- **Benefits of paper prototypes**
	- Inexpensive
    - Rapid iteration
    - Low commitment
    - Encourage honest feedback
    - Collaborative activity
    
- **Drawbacks of paper prototypes**
	- Hard to interpret
    - Tested in person
    - Difficult to create with a remote team
    
- Paper prototypes are great to build during early product testing, especially if there are ideas that need to be clarified with visual portrayals. Paper prototypes are also useful during brainstorming sessions.
- Creating paper prototypes during brainstorming situations is also useful because designers can quickly draw and compare multiple ideas. Theyâ€™re also useful during early product testing in order to provide visual portrayals of potential solutions.

### Understand ethical and inclusive design

> Recognize implicit bias in design

- Implicit biases: The collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate with people without our conscious knowledge
- Implicit bias is just one reason why creating and following personas and user journey maps is so important

- For example, imagine you're designing an app to help parents buying childcare. To personalize your onboarding process, you start by showing the message Welcome moms, we're here to help you find the right babysitter for your little one. 
- You might have thought that by addressing users directly as moms, you're humanizing the experience. But there's something wrong with this message. 
- It immediately excludes every other type of caregiver, like grandparents, guardians, dads and others. Implicit bias like this leaves out important users, which is bad for business
