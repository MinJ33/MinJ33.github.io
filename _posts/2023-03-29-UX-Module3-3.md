## 3. Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Prototypes
### Module 3: Building low-fidelity prototypes

> Learning Objectives
- Create a paper prototype
- Define the difference between a wireframe and a prototype
- Explain the path from digital wireframes to a digital lo-fi prototype in Figma
- Build a low-fidelity prototype in Figma
- Recognize and avoid implicit bias in design
- Identify common deceptive patterns in UX design
- Understand how to avoid the effects of deceptive patterns

### Create low-fidelity prototypes on paper

> Learn about low-fidelity prototypes

- Prototype: An early model of a product that demonstrates functionality
- Fidelity: How closely a design matches the look-and-feel of the final product
- Low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototype: A simple interactive model that provides a basic idea of what the product would look like
