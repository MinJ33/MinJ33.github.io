## 3. Build Wireframes and Low-Fidelity Prototypes
### Module 3: Building low-fidelity prototypes

> Learning Objectives
- Create a paper prototype
- Define the difference between a wireframe and a prototype
- Explain the path from digital wireframes to a digital lo-fi prototype in Figma
- Build a low-fidelity prototype in Figma
- Recognize and avoid implicit bias in design
- Identify common deceptive patterns in UX design
- Understand how to avoid the effects of deceptive patterns

### Create low-fidelity prototypes on paper

> Learn about low-fidelity prototypes

- Prototype: An early model of a product that demonstrates functionality
- Fidelity: How closely a design matches the look-and-feel of the final product
- Low-fidelity (lo-fi) prototype: A simple interactive model that provides a basic idea of what the product would look like

> Create a paper prototype

- **Benefits of paper prototypes**
	- Inexpensive
    - Rapid iteration
    - Low commitment
    - Encourage honest feedback
    - Collaborative activity
    
- **Drawbacks of paper prototypes**
	- Hard to interpret
    - Tested in person
    - Difficult to create with a remote team
    
- Paper prototypes are great to build during early product testing, especially if there are ideas that need to be clarified with visual portrayals. Paper prototypes are also useful during brainstorming sessions.
- Creating paper prototypes during brainstorming situations is also useful because designers can quickly draw and compare multiple ideas. Theyâ€™re also useful during early product testing in order to provide visual portrayals of potential solutions.

### Build low-fidelity prototypes digitally

### Understand ethical and inclusive design

> Recognize implicit bias in design

- Implicit biases: The collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate with people without our conscious knowledge
- Implicit bias is just one reason why creating and following personas and user journey maps is so important

- For example, imagine you're designing an app to help parents buying childcare. To personalize your onboarding process, you start by showing the message Welcome moms, we're here to help you find the right babysitter for your little one. 
- You might have thought that by addressing users directly as moms, you're humanizing the experience. But there's something wrong with this message. 
- It immediately excludes every other type of caregiver, like grandparents, guardians, dads and others. Implicit bias like this leaves out important users, which is bad for business

> Identify deceptive patterns in UX design

- **Deceptive patterns**: UX methods that trick users into doing or buying something they wouldn't otherwise have done or bought

	- 1. Forced continuity: 
    - The practice of charging a user for a membership without a warning or a reminder.
    - For example, you sign up for a seven-day free trial of a streaming service, and then notice that your credit card was charged on Day 7, but you weren't emailed or notified that your free trial was coming to an end

    - 2. Sneak into basket:
    - With the sneak into basket pattern, a user has to remove an item from their cart if they don't want to buy it, which is an extra step that could be easily missed

    - 3. Hidden costs:
    - Hidden costs is similar to sneak into basket, except there are extra charges in your cart instead of extra products. 
    - For example, a website might advertise free shipping, but then charge you for handling

    - 4. Confirmshaming:
    - When users are made to feel guilty when they opt out of something. 
    - An example of confirmshaming is when a user is attempting to make a choice and the copy inside of the button is attempting to make them feel guilty about their choice. These are added with the hope that users will choose to opt-in to a service being provided because they are worried they'll be missing out.

    - 5. Urgency:
    - They convince you that you need to purchase an item before you run out of time or miss today's amazing price

    - 6. Scarcity:
    - When a website makes users very aware of the limited number of items in stock.
    - An example of scarcity is when a website says that there are only five of this item left, usually followed by a message that urges the user to make a purchase before it's too late.
