## 1. Foundations of User Experience (UX) Design
### Module 1: Introducing user experience design

> User experience: How a person, the user, feels about interacting with, or experiencing, a product.

- Product: A good, service, or feature
	- It might me a physical product, like a video game controller, or a bag or potato chips, or a technology product, like an app, website, or smartwatch

> Characteristics of a good user experience

- For a user to have a good experience the product needs to be:
	- **Usable**: making something easier to use, purpose of product should be clear to everyone.
    - **Equitable**: being equitable means your designs are useful and marketable to ppl with diverse abilities and backgrounds.
    - **Enjoyable**: making things enjoyable to use, which creates a positive conection btwn the user and the product. 
    - **Useful**: solving problems. For example, if a map app telling you how to get home is useful. But if the app can't find your current location, it's not so useful anymore. 
    
> Common characteristics of ppl drawn to UX design

- A lot of UX designers have a good sense for visuals But you don't need to know anything about graphic design or even be able to draw to be a UX designer.
- UX designers tend to be curious about ppl and like thinking about how ppl's minds work.
- They also enjoy figuring out how people use products and how to make those products easier to use. 

> What UX designers actually do

- Interaction designers: focus on designing the experience of a product and how it functions. They figure out how to connect the users' needs and the business's goals with what's actually feasible to build.
- Visual designers: focus on how a product or technology looks. They might be responsible for designing logos, illustrations, or icons. They may also decide font color and size, or work on product layouts.
- Motion designers: They think about what it feels like for a user to move through a product and how to create smooth transitions between pages on an app or a website.

> Graphic designers vs UX designers

- Graphic designers
	- Create visuals that tell a story or message.
    - Focus on the physical appearance of a product.
- UX designers
	- Focus on how users interact with a product.


> The product development life cycle

- The process used to take a product from an idea to reality.
- There are five stages
#
	- **Brainstorm**: An active discovery stage that's all about generating ideas about the user and potential needs or challenges the user might have.
    - UX Research and writers are often plays key role in this stage.
#
    
    - **Define**: Define is all about using the insights from the brainstorm stage and starting to narrow the focus.
    - As a UX designer, you'll begin to think more about specific details related to the product.
#
     - **Design**: UX designers begin to actively develop ideas, and they also check that all specifications from the define stage are realistic.
     - Generally, UX designers start by drawing wireframes, which are outlines or sketches of the product, then move on to creating prototypes, which are early models of a product that convey its functionality. 
     - For example, UX designers might check that the screens of an app flow in a way that makes sense to the user. Or that each interaction, like tapping a button, has a correlating action, like an item getting added to a cart.
#    
    - **Test**: In the test stage, the team evaluates the product design based on feedback from potential users.
    - This is a stage that involves lots of interaction between ux designers and front-end engineers as they figure out ways to create an end product that satisfies users' needs and it practical and functional
    - At this stage, the designs go through at least three phases of testing:
    - First, the team tests the product internally to look for technical glitches and usability problems. This is often referred to as alpha testing. 
	- Then, the product undergoes a test with stakeholders to make sure the product is aligned with the company’s vision, meets legal guidelines for accessibility, and follows government regulations for privacy, for example. 
	- Finally, there’s an external test with potential users. This is the time to figure out whether the product provides a good user experience, meaning it’s usable, equitable, enjoyable, and useful. This is often referred to as beta testing.
#    
    - **Launch**: Sharing a finished version of the product with the public.
