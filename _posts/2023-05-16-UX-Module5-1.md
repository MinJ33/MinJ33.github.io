## 5. Create High-Fidelity Designs and Prototypes in Figma
### Module 1: Starting to create mockups

> Learning Objectives
	
  - Define the role and purpose of a mockup
	- Create a mockup in Figma
	- Apply foundational elements of visual design to mockups, including typography, color, and iconography
	- Use grids and containment elements in mockup layouts
	- Demonstrate the benefits of using negative space to improve mockups

### Begin to create a mockup

> Welcome to week 1

- Visual design: How a product or technology appears to users
- Mockup: A high fidelity design that represents your final product

> Introduction to mockups

- Fidelity: How closely a design matches the look and feel of the final product
- Low fidelity(lo-fi): A design that has a lower amount of complexity and is less refined or polished
- High fidelity(hi-fi): A design that closely matches the look and feel of the final product and is more refined or polished overall
- Mockup: A static, high fidelity design that is used as a representation of a final product

### Use typography in mockups

> Typography in UX design

- Typography: The use of text and font
- **Three steps to find the perfect typography** for your design: 
	- Selecting a type classification
    - Picking a typeface
    - Choosing a font
    
- **Type clasification**: A general system to describe styles of type
![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/0a5df108-ef9d-42d8-b6ad-e0bfe9e1bf96/image.png)
	- Two of the most popoular type classfications are Serif and Sans Serif
    - Notice that on the right side of the screen, there are no small lines hanging off of the T
	- This T is just a simple horizontal and vertical line. 
    - That's a clear indicator that this T falls into the sans serif type classification.

- **Typeface**: The overall style of a letter. Typefaces are distinguished by their stroke weight, shape, type of serif, and line lengths.
	- Each typeface is known by a family name. 
    - Some examples of serif typefaces are Times New Roman, Georgia, and Cambria.
	- A few examples of sans serif typefaces include Arial, Helvetica, and Verdana.

- **Font**: The size, thickness, and emphasis of letters
	- Difference between typeface and font:

    - The font on the right side of the screen is a collection of all of the characters of a typeface in one size and one style
    - For example, Roboto Bold in 12-point size is a font, and Roboto Light in 18-point size is also a font

> The importance of typography

- **Typographic hierarchy**: A method of ordering typefaces and fonts in a layout to create divisions that show users where to focus and how to find information
- Why typography is so imp?
	- Adds hierarchy
    - Makes text easy to read (legibility) 
    - Matches brand guidelines: visual style choices used to communicate a brand's identity, values, and mission
    	- For example, Google uses a sans serif typeface called Google Sans

### Use color in mockups

> Color in UX design

- **The importance **
	- Add emphasis
    - Communicate branding
    - Impact the accessibility of designs

- **60-30-10 rule**
	- One neutral color makes up 60% of the color palette
    - A second complementary color makes up 30% of the palette
    - A third accent color makes up 10% of the palette to add emphasis

> Accessibility considerations for color

- **Color blindness** results in difficulty distinguishing between certain colors. 
- There are three common categories of color blindness: red-green, blue-yellow, and total color blindness. 
- To understand how color blindness can affect how users see color, visit the Colblindor Color Blindness Simulator, where you can upload images and check them through various colorblind filters. 
- There are a few ways to keep color accessibility in mind as you design:

    - **Use icons in designs**
	- The exclamation point icon will draw users' attention to the form field with the color and the icon, so your designs will be clearer to more users.

    - **Use patterns and texture to create contrast**
    - To create contrast without relying on color alone, you can add subtle stripes to one column and dots to another, as shown in the image below. 
    - With contrasting patterns, in addition to color, the bars in the graph will be clearly differentiated for all users.

    - **Avoid color combinations that could be hard to distinguish from one another**
    - If you use green in your designs, that doesn’t mean you need to avoid red, brown, blue, and gray altogether. 
    - But because these colors can be hard to distinguish, it’s better to not put those colors directly next to each other, especially for critical information. 
    - In addition, you should create other forms of contrast, like adding written labels to differentiate important facts. 

- **Low contrast sensitivity**
- People who have low contrast sensitivity experience objects as dim or unclear, which makes those objects more difficult for a person to identify.
- One way that you can design with low contrast sensitivity in mind is to use the luminosity contrast ratio, which is a measurement of the contrast between the background and the text color used on top of that background. 
- As a standard, the WCAG recommends that the luminosity contrast ratio of images and text meets a contrast ratio of at least 4.5 : 1
![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/702ebd99-10b0-43d9-a676-7394865dd8a2/image.png)
- Low contrast has a ratio of 2 : 1. As you can tell, the background color and text are difficult to read.
- Minimum contrast has a ratio of 4.5 : 1. These background and text combinations are easier to read, even though they use light colors.
- High contrast has a ratio of 16 :1. These designs are easy to read and use bolder colors for text that stand out on the backgrounds.  
- Maximum contrast has a ratio of 21 : 1. For the most contrast in your designs, like these, use black and white only.

- **Light sensitivity**
- Light sensitivity is the inability to tolerate light. 
- Users who have light sensitivity might experience your designs with a dim screen. 
- Or they might use the operating system of their device to choose between light mode, dark mode, and high contrast mode, as shown in the image below. It's best to allow users to make these setting choices, so try designing your own light and dark modes of your own projects.

- **Consider color**
- As always, the goal of designing a great user experience is to make people’s lives simpler and better.
