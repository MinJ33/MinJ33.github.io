## 5. Create High-Fidelity Designs and Prototypes in Figma
### Module 1: Starting to create mockups

> Learning Objectives
	
  - Define the role and purpose of a mockup
	- Create a mockup in Figma
	- Apply foundational elements of visual design to mockups, including typography, color, and iconography
	- Use grids and containment elements in mockup layouts
	- Demonstrate the benefits of using negative space to improve mockups

### Begin to create a mockup

> Welcome to week 1

- Visual design: How a product or technology appears to users
- Mockup: A high fidelity design that represents your final product

> Introduction to mockups

- Fidelity: How closely a design matches the look and feel of the final product
- Low fidelity(lo-fi): A design that has a lower amount of complexity and is less refined or polished
- High fidelity(hi-fi): A design that closely matches the look and feel of the final product and is more refined or polished overall
- Mockup: A static, high fidelity design that is used as a representation of a final product

### Use typography in mockups

> Typography in UX design

- Typography: The use of text and font
- **Three steps to find the perfect typography** for your design: 
	- Selecting a type classification
    - Picking a typeface
    - Choosing a font
    
- **Type clasification**: A general system to describe styles of type

	- Two of the most popoular type classfications are Serif and Sans Serif
    - Notice that on the right side of the screen, there are no small lines hanging off of the T
	- This T is just a simple horizontal and vertical line. 
    - That's a clear indicator that this T falls into the sans serif type classification.

- **Typeface**: The overall style of a letter. Typefaces are distinguished by their stroke weight, shape, type of serif, and line lengths.
	- Each typeface is known by a family name. 
    - Some examples of serif typefaces are Times New Roman, Georgia, and Cambria.
	- A few examples of sans serif typefaces include Arial, Helvetica, and Verdana.

- **Font**: The size, thickness, and emphasis of letters
	- Difference between typeface and font:

    - The font on the right side of the screen is a collection of all of the characters of a typeface in one size and one style
    - For example, Roboto Bold in 12-point size is a font, and Roboto Light in 18-point size is also a font
