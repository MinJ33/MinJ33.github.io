## 7. Design a User Experience for Social Good & Prepare for Jobs

> Design for mobile first

- **Mobile first** is a design philosophy that seeks to start the design process with the mobile version of a product and later adapt it to fit larger screens, like a tablet or computer. In this course, you’ll design for mobile first by creating a dedicated mobile app and a responsive website, where you’ll start your project by designing for a mobile screen size 
-  Mobile-first design prioritizes creating a basic version for small screens first, while graceful degradation starts with a feature-rich design for large screens and scales down

> Design across devices with the 4 Cs

- **To design effectively for a specific device, consider:**
	- Screen size
    - Resolution
    - Context of use
    - Funtionality
    - Input methods
    - Content layout
    
- **The four Cs**
	- Consistency: Having a uniform design, so users can expect the design to feel familiar across devices and products
    - Continuity: Providing users with a smooth and uninterrupted experience as they move between devices
    - Context: Designing for the needs of a specific device and the way in which the user will use that device in any given situation
    - Complementary: Taking into account how each device can make the overall user experience even better

> Differentiate between dedicated mobile apps and responsive wep apps

- **Dedicated mobile apps**: Built to live on the mobile device and is accessed through an icon on the phone's home screen
- **Responsive web apps**: An actual website that adapts to the device the user is on and is accessed through a mobile phone's web browser
