## Weekly challenge 1: Create personas for your portfolio project
#
>Your submission <br/>

As you work through creating your personas, ask yourself:
- Did the demographic information match the characteristics derived from the user groups represented in your original notes?
- Does your quote showcase each persona's personality?
- Were the goals and frustrations aligned with the personas and the activity scenario?
 - Were you able to give more information about the personas, tying in their goals and frustrations, as well as their quote?
- What were the key identifiable differences between your two personas that ensured you were thinking about different user groups and why did you choose them?
- Did you include a picture or avatar representing each of the personas for your activity?
