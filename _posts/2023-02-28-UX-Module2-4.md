> Understand design ideation

- **Ideation**: The process of generating a broad set of ideas on a given topic, with no attempt to judge or evaluate them.
- One of the best things about ideation is the mentality that there are no bad ideas.
- Part of being a designer means intentionally exploring as many ideas as possible, knowing that some of them, or even most of them won't work.
- When you start thinking of ideas, you want to come up with as many as possible. The aim is to generate lots of ideas, even ones that may seem ridiculous at first. Sometimes your most outrageous idea will turn into a great and unique solution.
 
- Ideation in the real world
	- Brainstorm out loud
	- Document all ideas
	- Focus on quantity
	- Do not allow evalutation
	- Gather a diverse team
	- Question the obvious
	- Evaluate the ideas

- There are a few common ways to evaluate your ideas.
	- Feasible: Technically possible to build
    - Desirable: Best at solving the user problem(Does it solve the user problem you're focusing on?)
    - Viable: Financially beneficial for the business

**Empathize with your user.**
- Empathizing is the first step in the design process. You need to know who you’re solving for and what their needs are. 
- You empathized with your user already by creating empathy maps, personas, user stories, and user journey maps.

**Define the problem. **
- Defining is the second step in the design process. The problem you’re trying to solve should be well-defined, so that everyone on your team can think of ideas to solve the same problem. 
- Knowing exactly what problem you need to solve will also keep your users’ needs top-of-mind.

**Establish a creative environment.**
- You’ll need a comfortable space where everyone on your team can get together and present their ideas. If you’re meeting in person, choose an ideation space that’s different from your usual workspace. 
- If you’re ideating virtually, try to find a different space in your home that’s free of clutter and distractions.

**Set a time limit.**
- There are an endless number of possible products and features you could design, so give yourself plenty of time to come up with ideas. 
- However, you can’t brainstorm forever, so you’ll also need to set a time to stop brainstorming and start thinking more deeply about the ideas you’ve come up with.

**Assemble a diverse team.**
- You’re trying to come up with as many different ideas as possible. An inclusive team of people, with different races, genders, abilities, and backgrounds, will help you come up with all kinds of solutions.

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/977cf9bd-5d03-45b9-9f4b-c1db337b0ad9/image.png)
**Think outside the box.**
- Don’t limit yourself to traditional ideas and solutions. If you have a cool idea that seems a little different, write it down! Think big and get creative while ideating. 

> Explore lots of ideas

- Problem: Olivia is a parent who needs a way to ride her bike with her 2-year-old Luca because he can't ride his own bike.
- To solve for this problem you could design a seat behind the adult rider;

- Why should we come up with a lot of ideas?
	- List of ideas is narrowed based on constraints 
	- Need to focus on equity
	- Let users test the ideas

> Recognize business needs during design ideation

- Two major components of branding are voice and tone.
- Design can help facilitate a conversation between a business and its users.

> Scope the competition

- **Competitive audit**: An overview of your competitor's strengths and weaknesses
- What we can learn from a competitive audit:
	- Identifying your key competitors
    - Reviewing the products that your competitors offer
    - Understanding how your competitors poisition themselves in the market
    - Examining what your competition does well and what they could do better
    - Considering how your competitors talk about themselves

- Direct competitors: Have offerings that are similar to your product and focus on the same audience
- Indirect competitors: Have a similar set of offerings but focus on a different audience, or have a different set of offerings and focus on the same audience
![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/1828ba70-e097-46e6-8770-d8c0d6ad91d2/image.png)
- For example, you're creating a weight loss app that focuses on people in their 30s. 
	- Your direct competitors are other companies that also make weight loss apps targeted at people in their 30s. 
    - Your indirect competitors are any company that makes health or wellness apps targeted at people in their 30s, or make weight loss apps targeted at people in a different age bracket.
- It's helpful to audit a wide range of products that compete with yours to get a full picture of the landscape

Benefits to competitive audits
- Inform your design process
- Solve usability problems
- Reveal gaps in the market
- Provide reliable evidence
- Save time, money, and energy

> Learn more about competitive audits

- **Why are competitive audits important?**
- Consider how much work your direct and indirect competitors have already done to design and market their products to users. They’ve already had an impact on the industry that your product will enter. Studying these companies, their designs, and their user feedback is a fantastic source of information. 
- Competitive audits can offer many benefits throughout your ideation phase, including:
	- Giving you an idea of products already in the market and their designs. 
    - Suggesting ideas to solve early problems that you’re facing with your own designs. 
    - Revealing the ways that current products in the market are not meeting users’ needs. This is a gap for your product to address!
    - Demonstrating the expected life cycle of a product in the same market as yours.
    - Informing all the different iterations your product could take and how those performed for your competitors.

> Limits to competitive audits

- Stifle creativity. 
	- If you spend too much time focusing on what others are doing, you might prevent yourself from creating a truly innovative product
- Depend on how well you interpret the findings
- Not all designs work in all use cases
	- For example, imagine you're designing a website for a clothing company. A competitor has a feature that shows photos of customers wearing their brand's clothing on social media. But if your audience doesn't regularly use social media, this feature is not a good fit for your clothing website
- Need to be done regularly

> Steps to conduct a competitive audit

- 1. Outline the goals
- 2. Create a spreadsheet with a list of your competitors
- 3. Call out the specific aspects you want to compare
![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/c72f76c2-5c75-4e9b-8bfb-842769e93b61/image.png)
	- The names of your competitors are listed down the left side of the spreadsheet
![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/3fdf0193-296d-455e-b920-eedee067f19e/image.png)
    - The names of the aspects you want to compare are listed across the top
- 4. Research each company
- 5. Analyze findings
- 6. Summarize findings in a report

## Brainstorm design ideas by sketching
> Use how might we to ideate

- Another way to approach the ideation process, known as the "How Might We?" exercise. 
- **How Might We** is a design thinking activity used to translate problems into opportunities for design. 
	- The word **"how"** encourages us to explore a bunch of ideas instead of moving forward with only one idea for the solution. 
    - The word **"might"** emphasizes that our ideas are possible solutions, not the only solution. 
    - the word **"we"** suggests a collaborative effort. Coming up with ideas requires teamwork.
    
- Ways to create How Might We phrases
	- Amp up the good
    - Explore the opposite
    - Change a status quo
    - Break the point-of-view into pieces

> Best practices for How Might We

- **“How might we” (HMW) **is a design thinking activity used to translate problems into opportunities for design. 
- HMW gets your creativity flowing and encourages you to think about the problem from different perspectives. 
- This new vantage point helps you create a wide variety of solutions to the user problem you’re trying to address.

- Frame HMW questions
	- To create good HMW questions, you need a well-defined problem statement. From there, you can reframe this problem statement into questions that will help you come up with ideas to solve the problem.
	- Consider this problem that a user, Darren, faces: Darren is a concert goer who needs to keep track of their concert ticket because they need the ticket when they go through security. 
	- These tips will help you reframe the problem from different angles:

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/da7dd4a9-b73b-421d-8044-15bd4578ed1d/image.png)
**Amp up the good**
- Think of how you might use any positives in the problem as a solution. 
- How might we make keeping track of tickets a fun competition among friends? 

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/d7d6f982-5d4c-4f30-af11-734404317d68/image.png)
**Explore the opposite**
- Think of how you’d solve the opposite of the problem you’ve outlined. 
- How might we create a way to lose tickets?

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/dd357ece-5b92-4bd1-a5b4-f8fbdd8acc85/image.png)
**Change a status quo**
- Think of ways to completely change the process. 
- How might we make a non-paper concert ticket?

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/3fc6c566-ea12-4a79-a265-887ccaf729e0/image.png)
**Break the point-of-view into pieces**
- This is especially helpful for long, complex problems. 
- How might we keep the customer’s ticket from getting lost? How might we make a lost ticket easier for the security team to handle?

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/cad8ed23-78ad-4031-9182-c7e9e2b44b65/image.png)
**Remove the bad**
- Think of how to remove the negative part of the problem entirely. 
- How might we make a way for concert goers to enter a venue without needing a ticket?

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/7e67622e-e901-4fcf-90be-e906e001e168/image.png)
**Go after the adjective**
- Take any negative adjectives and try to turn them into positives. 
- How might we make the entry to a concert venue less stressful for ticket holders?

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/12e7bb46-b0a9-450f-9d9f-8fd0ae385f4e/image.png)
**Question an assumption**
- Remove or change any processes that you assume have to be in place. 
- How might we remove the security check process at a concert?

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/12707518-f24a-4f14-b8eb-bdcbc9a9fd45/image.png)
- Think of ways to compare this user experience to another experience.  
- How might we make going through security like playing a video game?

![](https://velog.velcdn.com/images/erica990604/post/dfcb0c5d-74c7-46d2-860a-65340bc809cb/image.png)
- Think of how the problem might be solved by a resource that isn’t mentioned in the problem statement. 
- How might facial recognition software help manage concert entry?

- Best practices for thinking of HMWs:
	- **Be broad.** A good HMW should allow for multiple solutions. For example, one of the earlier questions, How might we make keeping track of tickets fun and competitive?, can be answered in countless ways.

	- **But don’t be too broad.** You want your HMWs to be comprehensive, but narrow enough to keep your solutions focused. An example of a HMW question that is too broad is: How might we make ticketing better? This HMW doesn’t provide clear enough guidance to come up with ideas for solutions. 

	- **Make multiple drafts.** It’s okay to change your HMW questions after you’ve written them. If you find that your HMW doesn’t help you think of any useful solutions, change it up!

	- **Be creative.** HMWs are meant to be imaginative and even fun. You can use the list of tips from Stanford above to think of new, creative ways to frame your questions.

	- **Write as many HMWs as you can.** The more HMWs you have, the more solutions you can come up with. If you can make more than one question out of the frameworks you’ve learned, then go for it!

> Use Crazy Eights to ideate

- It's another popular design ideation exercise intended to help you think of several ideas in record time. 
- Crazy eights lets you compare ideas, see everyone's different ideas, and narrow down the list of ideas before moving on with the best solutions.
- Crazy Eights is a great way to get ideas flowing for any design problem you need to solve. With Crazy Eights, you’ll sketch eight different designs, each with a new idea for solving the user’s problem. The best part? It only takes eight minutes! Here’s a reminder of how it works:
	- **Start with a large sheet of paper.** Fold the paper in half, then fold it in half again, then in half one more time. When you unfold the paper, you’ll have eight squares to sketch in.
	- **Grab something to draw with.** A lot of designers prefer to draw using Sharpies, but a pencil or pen will work too. You can use whatever you already have to draw. 
	- **Set your timer to eight minutes.** You’ll have one minute to sketch each design idea.
	- **Let the ideas flow.** Draw any and every solution that comes to your mind. If you have more than eight ideas, feel free to repeat the exercise.

- Our practice problem statment: "Charles is a retired grandfather who needs a way to keep his essential belongings with him because he often loses track of his wallet"
