> Understand design ideation

- **Ideation**: The process of generating a broad set of ideas on a given topic, with no attempt to judge or evaluate them.
- One of the best things about ideation is the mentality that there are no bad ideas.
- Part of being a designer means intentionally exploring as many ideas as possible, knowing that some of them, or even most of them won't work.
- When you start thinking of ideas, you want to come up with as many as possible. The aim is to generate lots of ideas, even ones that may seem ridiculous at first. Sometimes your most outrageous idea will turn into a great and unique solution.
 
- Ideation in the real world
	- Brainstorm out loud
	- Document all ideas
	- Focus on quantity
	- Do not allow evalutation
	- Gather a diverse team
	- Question the obvious
	- Evaluate the ideas

- There are a few common ways to evaluate your ideas.
	- Feasible: Technically possible to build
    - Desirable: Best at solving the user problem(Does it solve the user problem you're focusing on?)
    - Viable: Financially beneficial for the business
