## 4. Conduct UX Research and Test Early Concepts
### Module 2: Conducting research with usability studies

> Learning Objectives
	- Take notes during a usability study
	- Discuss best practices to reduce bias when interviewing
	- Explain potential biases involved in moderating interviews
	- Apply techniques to build rapport with study participants
	- Explain how to conduct a moderated and an unmoderated usability study
	- Describe why and how to use usability studies

### Conduct a usability study

> Introduction to usability studies

- Usability study: A research method that assesses how easy it is for participants to complete core tasks in a design
- You can conduct usability studies when you have an interactive prototype, when you have a low-fidelity prototype, or when the product is complete

### Explore usability study best practices

> Explore usability study best practices: Before the study begins

- How to begin a moderated usability study
	- 1. Build a rapport with participants
    - 2. Thank participants for comin
    - 3. Remind participants to be open and honest
    - 4. Have paricipants fill out paperwork, like an NDA
    - 5. Explain the focus of the study and what participants will give feedback on
    - 6. Establish ground rules for the study
    - 7. Remind participants that they are not being tested
    - 8. Keep your emotions neutral

> Explore usability study best practices: During the study

- Techniques for moderating a uability study
	- Ask open-ended questions
    - Ask follow up questions
    - Summarize their answer for confirmation
    	- Always ask the participant open-ended and follow-up questions first. Then use this technique if you're still unclear because you might run the risk of leading the participant to a certain answer.

- Starting with **getting-to-know-you** small talk can make it easier for participants to feel comfortable and open up, both in person and virtually. 
- You want to establish a professional-but-friendly rapport with participants right from the start. Here are some good questions to kickstart the conversation:
	- How is your day going?
	- Did you have an easy time getting here (or signing on)?
	- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? 
	- Do you have any favorite hobbies?
- Then, **thank participants for coming**. Communicate how grateful you are that the participant is taking the time to participate in the study.  

- It’s also helpful to remind participants that they should be **open and honest** about their experience, so the design team can make improvements
- Finally, make sure the **space** you’re conducting the study in is physically comfortable. Usability studies can take place in a usability lab, inside someone's home, in a public area, or online. Each one requires a different setup to ensure participants are feeling at ease and properly accommodated

- When engaging with participants of different backgrounds and abilities, **use people-first language**
- **Marginalized communities** are ones where people have specific characteristics and life experiences that prevent them from fitting into what society inaccurately defines as “normal”
- The definition of which people fit into a marginlized community changes on the context. For example, when designing a tool like a kitchen gadget, you may want to consider if the design supports users who are left-handed.

- Ask participants to sign a **nondisclosure agreement** (NDA), which informs participants that they can’t talk about your product or the usability study publicly. 
- If the NDA is set up correctly, it helps build trust with participants and increase rapport
- Participants also need to sign paperwork to **allow their session to be recorded.** You might record a usability study session through a paper note sheet, screen recorder, video recorder, or audio recorder.

- **Explain the focus of the study** and what participants will give feedback on. 
- You’ll want to introduce the **think-aloud method**, which is a type of data gathering that has participants turn their internal thoughts into shared ideas through spoken, signed, or typed words. 
- When you use the think-aloud method, participants explain what they’re doing while they’re completing tasks. 
- This gives you, as the researcher, an opportunity to record exactly what participants are thinking about a product, in addition to what you observe them doing during the study.

- Here are a few pro tips to help you ask the right questions during a usability study:
	- **Use the same set of questions with each participant.** Usability studies typically focus on one person at a time, so you want your conversations with each user to be about the same design features. Keep your research consistent.

	- **Ask open-ended questions.** Avoid asking “yes” or “no” questions. Instead, ask questions that start with “why.” This will allow for more detailed feedback and might reveal useful information you can later include in your product.

	- **Encourage elaboration.** Sometimes, the script of questions you pre-wrote while planning the study isn’t thorough enough. Ask follow-up questions if you need to dig deeper. Maybe something unexpected came up and you want to explore it, or you didn’t get enough information from a participant’s first response and need them to elaborate. If you’re unsure how to ask a follow-up question, the phrase “tell me more about that” usually works. 

	- **Ask the same question from different angles.** Interviews can be awkward, so it might take awhile before you find out what participants really think. You can prepare for this delay by asking the same question from multiple angles. For example, you might ask, “How often do you go to the grocery store?” at the start of the interview; then, “How many times per week do you go to the grocery store” in the middle of the interview. The participant might give you a more detailed answer the second time around, which can help you get more accurate insights and useful data.

	- **Don’t mention other participants.** Talking about other participants can lead to privacy violations and skew the answers of the participant you’re with, which leads to inaccurate data.

	- **Don’t ask leading questions.** Be careful about how you word each question. Participants can pick up on your preconceived notions if your questions are worded in a biased way. For example, if you ask, “Why do you think apples are more popular than pears?” then the participant is primed to answer positively about apples and negatively about pears. Instead, try asking a more neutral, open-ended question, like: “Do you prefer apples or pears, and why?” 

### Identify biases when interviewing participants

> Identify biases when interviewing usability study participants

- **Implicit bias**: The collection of attitudes and stereotypes we associate to people without our conscious knowledge

- **Serial position effect**: When given a list of items, people are more likely to remeber the first few and the last few, while the items in the middle tend to blur

- **Friendliness bias**: The tendency of people to agree with those they like in order to maintain a non-confrontational conversation

- **Social desirability bias**: The tendency for people to answer questions in a way that will be viewed favourbly by others 

> How to reduce bias in interviews

- How to reduce bias when conducting usability studies 
	- Identify and admit your own biases
    - Find participants from a representative sample
    - Define the research criteria beforehand
    - Phrase interview questions thoughtfully
    - Let participants express themselves fully and in their own words
    - Be mindful of your body language

**Confirmation bias**
- The tendency to focus on information that matches a pre-existing belief
- Pro-tips to help you combat this bias:
	- **Recruit an appropriate sample size** 
    	- In the real world, many UX researchers want to have five to eight participants when conducting a usability study.
        - Interviewing the right number of participants and gathering a variety of perspectives will help reduce confirmation bias.
	- **It's not about your beliefs**
    	- Pay attention to and embrace findings that challenge your hypotheses.
        - If participants share ideas that contradict your assumptions, it could highlight the need to dig into an issue more deeply and can pave the way for new learnings to emerge

**Leading questions**
- research questions that are intentionally framed to guide participants to respond in a certain way
- Pro-tips to help you combat this bias:
	- **Encourage participants to think aloud.** 
    	- Ask interviewees to share all of their thoughts as they review a product. 
    	- After each interview question or task, pause to provide participants extra time to share additional thoughts.
    - **Limit your responses**
    	- When you are conducting research, try not to offer your own opinions, like, “Yes! That’s true. I totally agree.” This type of feedback can shape participants' responses because participants are likely to want to receive more validating feedback
