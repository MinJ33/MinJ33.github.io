- Starting with **getting-to-know-you** small talk can make it easier for participants to feel comfortable and open up, both in person and virtually. 
- You want to establish a professional-but-friendly rapport with participants right from the start. Here are some good questions to kickstart the conversation:
	- How is your day going?
	- Did you have an easy time getting here (or signing on)?
	- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? 
	- Do you have any favorite hobbies?
- Then, **thank participants for coming**. Communicate how grateful you are that the participant is taking the time to participate in the study.  

- It’s also helpful to remind participants that they should be **open and honest** about their experience, so the design team can make improvements
- Finally, make sure the **space** you’re conducting the study in is physically comfortable. Usability studies can take place in a usability lab, inside someone's home, in a public area, or online. Each one requires a different setup to ensure participants are feeling at ease and properly accommodated
