## 4. Conduct UX Research and Test Early Concepts
### Module 2: Conducting research with usability studies

> Learning Objectives
	- Take notes during a usability study
	- Discuss best practices to reduce bias when interviewing
	- Explain potential biases involved in moderating interviews
	- Apply techniques to build rapport with study participants
	- Explain how to conduct a moderated and an unmoderated usability study
	- Describe why and how to use usability studies

### Conduct a usability study

> Introduction to usability studies

- Usability study: A research method that assesses how easy it is for participants to complete core tasks in a design
- You can conduct usability studies when you have an interactive prototype, when you have a low-fidelity prototype, or when the product is complete

### Explore usability study best practices

> Explore usability study best practices: Before the study begins

- How to begin a moderated usability study
	- 1. Build a rapport with participants
    - 2. Thank participants for comin
    - 3. Remind participants to be open and honest
    - 4. Have paricipants fill out paperwork, like an NDA
    - 5. Explain the focus of the study and what participants will give feedback on
    - 6. Establish ground rules for the study
    - 7. Remind participants that they are not being tested
    - 8. Keep your emotions neutral

> Explore usability study best practices: During the study

- Techniques for moderating a uability study
	- Ask open-ended questions
    - Ask follow up questions
    - Summarize their answer for confirmation
    	- Always ask the participant open-ended and follow-up questions first. Then use this technique if you're still unclear because you might run the risk of leading the participant to a certain answer.

- Starting with **getting-to-know-you** small talk can make it easier for participants to feel comfortable and open up, both in person and virtually. 
- You want to establish a professional-but-friendly rapport with participants right from the start. Here are some good questions to kickstart the conversation:
	- How is your day going?
	- Did you have an easy time getting here (or signing on)?
	- Can you tell me a little bit about yourself? 
	- Do you have any favorite hobbies?
- Then, **thank participants for coming**. Communicate how grateful you are that the participant is taking the time to participate in the study.  

- It’s also helpful to remind participants that they should be **open and honest** about their experience, so the design team can make improvements
- Finally, make sure the **space** you’re conducting the study in is physically comfortable. Usability studies can take place in a usability lab, inside someone's home, in a public area, or online. Each one requires a different setup to ensure participants are feeling at ease and properly accommodated

- When engaging with participants of different backgrounds and abilities, **use people-first language**
- **Marginalized communities** are ones where people have specific characteristics and life experiences that prevent them from fitting into what society inaccurately defines as “normal”
- The definition of which people fit into a marginlized community changes on the context. For example, when designing a tool like a kitchen gadget, you may want to consider if the design supports users who are left-handed.

- Ask participants to sign a **nondisclosure agreement** (NDA), which informs participants that they can’t talk about your product or the usability study publicly. 
- If the NDA is set up correctly, it helps build trust with participants and increase rapport
- Participants also need to sign paperwork to **allow their session to be recorded.** You might record a usability study session through a paper note sheet, screen recorder, video recorder, or audio recorder.

- **Explain the focus of the study** and what participants will give feedback on. 
- You’ll want to introduce the **think-aloud method**, which is a type of data gathering that has participants turn their internal thoughts into shared ideas through spoken, signed, or typed words. 
- When you use the think-aloud method, participants explain what they’re doing while they’re completing tasks. 
- This gives you, as the researcher, an opportunity to record exactly what participants are thinking about a product, in addition to what you observe them doing during the study.
