> Intro to design sprints

- The goal of design sprints is to solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users. 
- At Google, we use design sprints to answer questions, define product directions, figure out cross-team strategies, and even build team culture.
- Design sprints generally include five phases: 1)understand, 2)ideate, 3)decide, 4)prototype, and 5)test.
- **Design sprint benefits**
	- Save time
    - Create a path to bring a product to market
    - Prioritize the user
    - Test product before launch
    #
    - Before launching into a design sprint, you need to review your design challenge and ask yourself these ***key questions***:
    - Are there many potential solutions to your design challenge?
    - Does a design challenge require people from cross-functional teams to weigh in?
    - Is the design challenge's scope wide enough for a sprint?

- To recap the **five phases** of design sprints are: 
	- **Understand** the scope of the design challenge. The team took time to learn from and engage in discussions with industry experts. These steps help team members understand the design challenge more clearly.
    - **Ideate** possible solutions.
    - By the time you reach phase three, you have a lot of potential solutions for your design challenge. Now it's time to **decide** on the most viable solution.
    - Create a workable **prototype**. During this phase, you also finish prepping for user testing by confirming the test schedule, finalizing interview questions, and making sure your prototype is good to go. 
    - Finally, **test** that prototype with actual users.

> Benefits of design sprints

- First it's all about the user. 
	- Sprint participants make sure the design challenge is always focused on the user and their needs. After all, it's the users who ultimately decide if your product is successful
- Second, sprints value every person in the room
	- From the office intern to the senior stakeholder, including people from lots of disciplines and experience levels is a key part of the process. It means the best ideas will rise to the top. 
- Next, it gives the core team time to focus solely on a design challenge. 
- It lower the risk of an unsuccessful market debut because the team gets feedback from real users and can make critical adjustments before the product launches. 
- Finally, sprints are versatile because they can be scheduled at any point during your project. When a challenge arises, you've always got the design sprint option in your back pocket.
