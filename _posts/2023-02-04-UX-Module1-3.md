> Intro to design sprints

- The goal of design sprints is to solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users. 
- At Google, we use design sprints to answer questions, define product directions, figure out cross-team strategies, and even build team culture.
- Design sprints generally include five phases: 1)understand, 2)ideate, 3)decide, 4)prototype, and 5)test.
- **Design sprint benefits**
	- Save time
    - Create a path to bring a product to market
    - Prioritize the user
    - Test product before launch
    #
    - Before launching into a design sprint, you need to review your design challenge and ask yourself these ***key questions***:
    - Are there many potential solutions to your design challenge?
    - Does a design challenge require people from cross-functional teams to weigh in?
    - Is the design challenge's scope wide enough for a sprint?

- To recap the **five phases** of design sprints are: 
	- **Understand** the scope of the design challenge. The team took time to learn from and engage in discussions with industry experts. These steps help team members understand the design challenge more clearly.
    - **Ideate** possible solutions.
    - By the time you reach phase three, you have a lot of potential solutions for your design challenge. Now it's time to **decide** on the most viable solution.
    - Create a workable **prototype**. During this phase, you also finish prepping for user testing by confirming the test schedule, finalizing interview questions, and making sure your prototype is good to go. 
    - Finally, **test** that prototype with actual users.

> Benefits of design sprints

- First it's all about the user. 
	- Sprint participants make sure the design challenge is always focused on the user and their needs. After all, it's the users who ultimately decide if your product is successful
- Second, sprints value every person in the room
	- From the office intern to the senior stakeholder, including people from lots of disciplines and experience levels is a key part of the process. It means the best ideas will rise to the top. 
- Next, it gives the core team time to focus solely on a design challenge. 
- It lower the risk of an unsuccessful market debut because the team gets feedback from real users and can make critical adjustments before the product launches. 
- Finally, sprints are versatile because they can be scheduled at any point during your project. When a challenge arises, you've always got the design sprint option in your back pocket.

> Plan design sprints

- Step 1) User research: it is always the first step in any sprint planning process.
	- Your research should focus on the user problems you're trying to solve during the sprint. You don't have to detail out a specific problem right away
- Step 2) Call in the experts: You'll listen to these info-packed talks during the understand phase of the sprint. 
	- A good talk helps clarify the problem your sprint is trying to solve. 
    - The more experts you bring in, the more schedules you have to accommodate. 
- Step 3) Find the right space: It's important to ensure that the space allows all employees equal opportunities to perform their job. 
- Step 4) Gather supplies: If you're planning the design sprint, it's your job to make sure everyone has what they need to participate, kind of like a teacher handing out classroom supplies. 
  - Some essentials include markers, sticky notes, and a lot of snacks and water.
- Step 5) Establish the rules of the sprint: Figuring out the ground rules in advance sets the tone for the sprint, gets everyone on the same page, and helps your team stay focused. 
- Step 6) Planning introductions: This can be pretty important since **sprints involve cross-functional teams** that may have never met before. 
	- We all know icebreakers can be a little cheesy, but they're still a great way to help your team get comfortable with each other. 
    - Plus, choosing icebreakers that are relevant to your sprint can motivate your team and put them in the right mindset. 
- Step 7) Post-sprint planning: How your team might use what you've learned to achieve other goals. 
  - To do this, you need documentation. Make sure you enlist a few people to help document the design sprint by taking pictures, collecting sticky notes, and jotting down ideas.

> The design sprint brief

- A document that you share with all your attendees to help them prepare for the sprint.

	- Start with the design sprint ***challenge***, this introduces your team to the sprint objectives.

	- Next, identify the ***key delieveries***,meaning what your team actually wants to create by the end of the sprint.

	- Then it's on to logistics. Everyone participating in the sprint needs to know where the sprint will happen and when it will be held.

	- Next, add ***approvers***. If your cycling app needs the official approval of Miss Cycling Enthusiasts, CEO before launching, the sprint brief should mention it.

	- Your sprint brief should also include a list of ***resources.***
    - For short-term sprints, there's probably a team already assigned to this project. 
    - For long-term sprints, you may need to create a plan to secure additional resources.

	 - Next, we have the project ***overview*** where you should explain the current status of the project.

     - Finally, we wrap it all up with the ***sprint schedule***, an hour-by-hour schedule of the five-day sprint, including break times.
