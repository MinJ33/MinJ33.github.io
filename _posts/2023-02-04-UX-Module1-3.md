> Intro to design sprints

- The goal of design sprints is to solve a critical design challenge through designing, prototyping, and testing ideas with users. 
- At Google, we use design sprints to answer questions, define product directions, figure out cross-team strategies, and even build team culture.
- Design sprints generally include five phases: 1)understand, 2)ideate, 3)decide, 4)prototype, and 5)test.
- **Design sprint benefits**
	- Save time
    - Create a path to bring a product to market
    - Prioritize the user
    - Test product before launch
    #
    - Before launching into a design sprint, you need to review your design challenge and ask yourself these ***key questions***:
    - Are there many potential solutions to your design challenge?
    - Does a design challenge require people from cross-functional teams to weigh in?
    - Is the design challenge's scope wide enough for a sprint?
