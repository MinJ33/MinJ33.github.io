- ***Empathy*** is the ability to understand someone else’s feelings or thoughts in a situation. 

> Understand empathy in UX design

- As a UX designer, empathizing with users enhances the products you create because you experience the product as your user does.
- The better you are at anticipating a user’s desires and needs, the more comfortable the user will feel with your design, and the more likely they will be to engage with your product long-term.
- UX design is not about solving problems we assume users want solved. It's about solving problems that users actually want solved.

> How to empathize with users

- **Ask lots of questions**
- As a UX designer, you cannot make assumptions about the needs of your users. Instead, ask your users directly about their needs and wants, which your product design can address. 
- Ask questions that begin with what, how, and why to gain a deeper understanding of your users’ perspective.

- **Become more observant**
- Shift your focus to the whole user physical cues that can affect your research outcomes and not just the words they are using. 
- To help capture observations, you’ll take detailed notes or even record your sessions with users.

- **Be an active listener**
- Active listening requires you to fully concentrate on, understand, and remember what is being said by the user you’re interacting with. Avoid getting distracted by where the conversation is going or what you might say next. 
- In UX design, practicing active listening can help you get impartial feedback directly from your users, which you can apply to improve your designs.

- **Request input**
- It’s important that the feedback you receive is objective and unbiased. Friends or colleagues often provide biased, mostly positive feedback because they want to support or please you.
- When asking for feedback, use open-ended questions to understand the user’s actual thoughts on the experience or product.

- **Have an open mind**
- We all have biases, but as UX designers, we have to set those biases aside to better empathize with others. 
- Your goal is to understand users, not to complicate their feedback with your own opinions and emotions.

- **Keep current on UX research**
- Follow researchers and join online communities to stay up-to-date on the research that affects UX designers and the users you’re designing for. 
- Research is always changing and evolving as we understand more about human psychology. Staying current will give you an advantage in how you understand and interact with your audience. 

> Empathy vs. sympathy 

- Empathy means understanding someone’s feelings or thoughts, often by feeling the emotions yourself. 
- Sympathy is the experience of showing concern or compassion without feeling the emotions themselves. 

> Recruit interview participants

- Screener survey: A detailed list of questions that helps researchers determine if potential participants meet the requirements of the research study.

- To determine the goals of the interview, ask yourself questions like the following: 
	- What do you want to learn from the interviews? 
    - Are there certain user problems or pain points that you need to empathize with? 
	- Are there any characteristics of users you want to interview? Why? 
    - How much information should we have to ensure we get a comprehensive and balanced set of data?
    
- Representative sample: A subset of the target population that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group.
