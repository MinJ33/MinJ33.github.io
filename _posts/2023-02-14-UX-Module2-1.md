- ***Empathy*** is the ability to understand someone else’s feelings or thoughts in a situation. 

> Understand empathy in UX design

- As a UX designer, empathizing with users enhances the products you create because you experience the product as your user does.
- The better you are at anticipating a user’s desires and needs, the more comfortable the user will feel with your design, and the more likely they will be to engage with your product long-term.
- UX design is not about solving problems we assume users want solved. It's about solving problems that users actually want solved.
