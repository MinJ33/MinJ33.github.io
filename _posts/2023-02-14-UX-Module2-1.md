> Learning Objectives
- Complete an empathy exercise to understand users
- Build an empathy map
- Explain user pain points
- Create personas

> Empathize with users

- ***Empathy*** is the ability to understand someone else’s feelings or thoughts in a situation. 

> Understand empathy in UX design

- As a UX designer, empathizing with users enhances the products you create because you experience the product as your user does.
- The better you are at anticipating a user’s desires and needs, the more comfortable the user will feel with your design, and the more likely they will be to engage with your product long-term.
- UX design is not about solving problems we assume users want solved. It's about solving problems that users actually want solved.

> How to empathize with users

- **Ask lots of questions**
- As a UX designer, you cannot make assumptions about the needs of your users. Instead, ask your users directly about their needs and wants, which your product design can address. 
- Ask questions that begin with what, how, and why to gain a deeper understanding of your users’ perspective.

- **Become more observant**
- Shift your focus to the whole user physical cues that can affect your research outcomes and not just the words they are using. 
- To help capture observations, you’ll take detailed notes or even record your sessions with users.

- **Be an active listener**
- Active listening requires you to fully concentrate on, understand, and remember what is being said by the user you’re interacting with. Avoid getting distracted by where the conversation is going or what you might say next. 
- In UX design, practicing active listening can help you get impartial feedback directly from your users, which you can apply to improve your designs.

- **Request input**
- It’s important that the feedback you receive is objective and unbiased. Friends or colleagues often provide biased, mostly positive feedback because they want to support or please you.
- When asking for feedback, use open-ended questions to understand the user’s actual thoughts on the experience or product.

- **Have an open mind**
- We all have biases, but as UX designers, we have to set those biases aside to better empathize with others. 
- Your goal is to understand users, not to complicate their feedback with your own opinions and emotions.

- **Keep current on UX research**
- Follow researchers and join online communities to stay up-to-date on the research that affects UX designers and the users you’re designing for. 
- Research is always changing and evolving as we understand more about human psychology. Staying current will give you an advantage in how you understand and interact with your audience. 

> Empathy vs. sympathy 

- Empathy means understanding someone’s feelings or thoughts, often by feeling the emotions yourself. 
- Sympathy is the experience of showing concern or compassion without feeling the emotions themselves. 

> Recruit interview participants

- Screener survey: A detailed list of questions that helps researchers determine if potential participants meet the requirements of the research study.

- To determine the goals of the interview, ask yourself questions like the following: 
	- What do you want to learn from the interviews? 
    - Are there certain user problems or pain points that you need to empathize with? 
	- Are there any characteristics of users you want to interview? Why? 
    - How much information should we have to ensure we get a comprehensive and balanced set of data?
    
- Representative sample: A subset of the target population that seeks to accurately reflect the characteristics of the larger group.

- How to reach out to each perspective participant via email

> Determine research goals and questions

1) **Determine research goals**
- As a UX designer, what do you want to learn from the interviews? Are there certain user problems or pain points that you need to empathize with?
- Examples of common research goals when it comes to empathizing with users:
    - I want to understand the processes and emotions that people experience around the problem my product is trying to solve.
    - I want to identify common user behaviors and experiences with tasks that my product is trying to address.
    - I want to understand user needs and frustrations as they relate to the product I’m designing.

2) **Write interview questions**

- The more aligned the interview questions are with your goals, the more useful the data you obtain will be.
- There are a few best practices to keep in mind when writing interview questions:
    - **Ask open-ended questions**: Open-ended questions allow the person being interviewed to answer freely, instead of with a simple “yes” or “no.”            
    - For example, if you’re designing an app to help people find dog walkers, you should ask “Could you describe your experience with finding and scheduling dog walkers?” instead of “Have you ever used an app to find a dog walker?” 
    - **Keep questions short and simple**: It should be easy for interview participants to understand what you’re asking.
    - **Ask follow-up questions**: During the empathize phase of the design process, interviews should be conversational, so encouraging participants to elaborate is a best practice. 
    - After a participant answers an interview question, try asking them “Why?” or use the phrase, “Tell me more about that” to keep the conversation flowing.

> Activity: Define your research goals and questions (Examplar-A mobile ticketing app for an amusement park)

-Interview goals:
	- I want to understand common challenges people face while using an theme park app.
	- I want to identify frustrations people experience during the process of buying tickets on app.

- Interview questions:

	1. How often do you visit other amusement parks? When you do, what is your motivation for doing so? 

	2. What challenges do you face in the ticketing process? How does this make you feel?

	3. Is there any way in which you feel these challenges could be resolved?
    
- Target participant characteristics:
	- Ages 18-54
	- Lives near the theme park or suburban areas
	- People who like to visit amusement park with their family or friends
	- Include participants of different genders
	- Include participants with disabilities

> Identify user pain points

- Pain points: Any UX issues that frustrate the user and block the user from getting what they need
- Types of pain points:
	- Financial: For example, getting lost in an online article, only to be rudely interrupted by a paywall.
    - Product: There are usually quality issues related to the product. Norman Doors fall into this category.
    - Process: These are frustrations that stop the user going from point A to point B.
    - Support: Customer service information that's hidden on a website falls into this category.
 > Brain + Heart = User Experience

 > Activity: Pain points vs Solutions
- When you can identify user pain points, you can develop more meaningful solutions. Get started by distinguishing pain points from solutions.

- Solution: A solution attempts to address a pain point, either by remedying the pain point or the root cause of the pain point.

- Pain point: A pain point is an issue or concern relevant to a given user. Pain points have root causes.

> Understand personas

- Personas: Fictional users whose goals and characteristics represent the needs of a larger group of users.
- First, we'll need to figure out what user group our persona represents.
- Each persona that you create will represent a group of users with similar characteristics that you’ve learned about through your research. 
- Personas are key to the design process because they reflect the lifestyles of users and give your team an idea of how to meet users’ needs or challenges.
	- User group: A set of people who have similar interests, goals, or concerns

- Include her photo and a short biographical sketch
- Include things like age, occupation, hometown, marital status, and any other demographic data points that might give us a better sense of who our user group is. 

Benefits of personas
- Build empathy and put a face to the user.They help humanize our users
- Tell stories
- Stress-test designs. 
- Personas make sure we designers create something that benefits a wide range of users.

> Learn more about personas

**Building personas**
- Personas are created by conducting user research and identifying common **pain points**, which are UX issues that frustrate and block the user from getting what they need from a product.
- As you create personas, look for the most common themes in your data and group the users who personify those themes together.
- Generally, creating 3 to 8 personas is enough to represent the majority of a product’s user base. 
- Here's what a persona might include for Daniela, using the persona template that was shown in the video:
